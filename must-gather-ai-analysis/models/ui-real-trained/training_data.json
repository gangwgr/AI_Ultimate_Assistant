The new government did not commence until the old government expired. It is apparent that the government did not commence on the Constitution's being ratified by the ninth state, for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognized by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members. It existed potentially until March 2, the day preceding that on which the members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\\\"\\nOwings v.

The president directs the\\nexecutive branch\\nof the\\nfederal government\\nand is the\\ncommander-in-chief\\nof the\\nUnited States Armed Forces\\n.\\nThe power of the presidency has grown\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nsince the first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\n, took office in 1789.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nWhile presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasing role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with some expansions during the presidencies of\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nand\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining\\nsuperpower\\n.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nAs the leader of the nation with the\\nlargest economy by nominal GDP\\n, the president possesses significant domestic and international\\nhard\\nand\\nsoft power\\n. For much of the 20th century, especially during the\\nCold War\\n, the U.S. president was often called \\\"the leader of the free world\\\".\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nArticle II of the Constitution\\nestablishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's\\nmost expensive military\\n, which has the\\nsecond-largest nuclear arsenal\\n.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of\\nseparation of powers\\n,\\nArticle I, Section\\n7\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or\\nveto\\nfederal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is\\nelected indirectly\\nthrough the\\nElectoral College\\nto a four-year term, along with the\\nvice president\\n. Under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a\\npresident's intra-term death\\nor\\nresignation\\n.\\n[\\nC\\n]\\nIn all,\\n45 individuals\\nhave served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.\\n[\\nD\\n]\\nDonald Trump\\nis the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\nIn July 1776, the\\nThirteen Colonies\\n, represented at the\\nSecond Continental Congress\\nin\\nPhiladelphia\\n, unanimously adopted the\\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\\nin which the colonies declared themselves to be independent\\nsovereign states\\nand no longer under\\nBritish\\nrule.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe affirmation was made in the\\nDeclaration of Independence\\n, which was written predominantly by\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the\\nBritish\\n,\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nthe Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates\\ntogether. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nCongress finished work on the\\nArticles of Confederation\\nto establish a\\nperpetual union\\nbetween the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for\\nratification\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nUnder the Articles, which\\ntook effect\\non March 1, 1781, the\\nCongress of the Confederation\\nwas a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThis institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of\\nCrown\\nand\\nParliament\\nought to have functioned with respect to the royal\\ndominion\\n: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly\\nroyal prerogatives\\n(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a\\npresident of the United States in Congress Assembled\\nto preside over its deliberation as a neutral\\ndiscussion moderator\\n. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1783, the\\nTreaty of Paris\\nsecured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nBy 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their\\nhard currency\\npouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their\\nMediterranean\\ncommerce preyed upon by\\nNorth African\\npirates\\n, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nCivil and political unrest loomed.  Events such as the\\nNewburgh Conspiracy\\nand\\nShays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between\\nVirginia\\nand Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference\\nin 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in\\nAnnapolis, Maryland\\n, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the\\nconvention\\nfailed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states,\\nAlexander Hamilton\\nof New York led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in\\nPhiladelphia\\n. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nEdmund Randolph\\nsucceeded in securing\\nGeorge Washington\\n's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nWhen the\\nConstitutional Convention\\nconvened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (\\nRhode Island\\ndid not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nNew York\\noffered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIt was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the\\nU.S. Constitution\\nemerged.\\n1789\\u20131933\\nGeorge Washington\\n, the first president of the United States\\nAs the nation's first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\nestablished many norms that would come to define the office.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nHis decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the\\nTwenty-Second Amendment\\n. By the end of his presidency, political parties had developed,\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nwith\\nJohn Adams\\ndefeating\\nThomas Jefferson\\nin 1796, the first truly contested presidential election.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nAfter Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow Virginians\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nJames Monroe\\nwould each serve two terms, eventually dominating the nation's politics during the\\nEra of Good Feelings\\nuntil Adams' son\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwon election in 1824 after the\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\nsplit.\\nThe election of\\nAndrew Jackson\\nin 1828 was a significant milestone, as Jackson was not part of the Virginia and Massachusetts elite that had held the presidency for its first 40 years.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nJacksonian democracy\\nsought to strengthen the presidency at the expense of Congress, while broadening public participation as the nation rapidly expanded westward. However, his successor,\\nMartin Van Buren\\n, became unpopular after the\\nPanic of 1837\\n,\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nand the death of\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nand subsequent poor relations between\\nJohn Tyler\\nand Congress led to further weakening of the office.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nIncluding Van Buren, in the 24 years between 1837 and 1861, six presidential terms would be filled by eight different men, with none serving two terms.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nThe Senate played an important role during this period, with the\\nGreat Triumvirate\\nof\\nHenry Clay\\n,\\nDaniel Webster\\n, and\\nJohn C. Calhoun\\nplaying key roles in shaping national policy in the 1830s and 1840s until debates over slavery began pulling the nation apart in the 1850s.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nAbraham Lincoln\\n's leadership during the\\nCivil War\\nhas led historians to regard him as one of the nation's greatest presidents.\\n[\\nE\\n]\\nThe circumstances of the war and Republican domination of Congress made the office very powerful,\\n[\\n37\\n]\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nand Lincoln's re-election in 1864 was the first time a president had been re-elected since Jackson in 1832. After Lincoln's assassination, his successor\\nAndrew Johnson\\nlost all political support\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nand was nearly removed from office,\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nwith Congress remaining powerful during the two-term presidency of Civil War general\\nUlysses S. Grant\\n. After the end of\\nReconstruction\\n,\\nGrover Cleveland\\nwould eventually become the first Democratic president elected since before the war, running in three consecutive elections (1884, 1888, 1892) and winning twice. In 1900,\\nWilliam McKinley\\nbecame the first incumbent to win re-election since Grant in 1872.\\nAfter McKinley's\\nassassination\\nby\\nLeon Czolgosz\\nin 1901,\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\nbecame a dominant figure in American politics.\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nHistorians believe Roosevelt permanently changed the political system by strengthening the presidency,\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nwith some key accomplishments including breaking up trusts, conservationism, labor reforms, making personal character as important as the issues, and hand-picking his successor,\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\n. The following decade,\\nWoodrow Wilson\\nled the nation to victory during\\nWorld War I\\n, although Wilson's proposal for the\\nLeague of Nations\\nwas rejected by the Senate.\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nWarren Harding\\n, while popular in office, would see his legacy tarnished by scandals, especially\\nTeapot Dome\\n,\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nand\\nHerbert Hoover\\nquickly became very unpopular after failing to alleviate the\\nGreat Depression\\n.\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nImperial presidency\\nMain article:\\nImperial presidency\\nPresident\\nFranklin D.

Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nPresident\\nLyndon B. Johnson\\nsigns the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act\\nat the\\nWhite House\\non July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\nand others look on.\\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the\\nPresentment Clause\\n, which gives the president the power to veto any\\nbill\\npassed by\\nCongress\\n. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\nof both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.  The veto \\u2013 or threat of a veto \\u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\nSign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill\\nbecomes law\\n.\\nVeto\\nthe legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\n.\\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto\\n.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the\\nLine Item Veto Act\\n. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In\\nClinton v. City of New York\\n,\\n524\\nU.S.\\n417\\n(1998), the\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nSetting the agenda\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump\\ndelivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore\\nCongress\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \\\"necessary and expedient\\\". This is done through the constitutionally-based\\nState of the Union\\naddress, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nPresidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of\\nagencies\\nthat can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\\"virtual army of 'czars'\\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\\".\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nPresidents have been criticized for making\\nsigning statements\\nwhen signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nThis practice has been criticized by the\\nAmerican Bar Association\\nas unconstitutional.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nConservative commentator\\nGeorge Will\\nwrote of an \\\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\\" and \\\"the eclipse of Congress\\\".\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by\\nArticle II, Section\\n3\\nof the Constitution to call a\\nspecial session\\nof one or both houses of Congress. Since\\nJohn Adams\\nfirst did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions.\\nHarry S. Truman\\nwas the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the\\nTurnip Day Session\\n. In addition, prior to ratification of the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\nin 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly\\ninaugurated\\npresidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nExecutive powers\\nMain article:\\nPowers of the president of the United States\\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

However, these nominations require\\nSenate confirmation\\nbefore they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to\\nU.S. district courts\\n, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of\\nsenatorial courtesy\\n. Presidents may also grant\\npardons\\nand\\nreprieves\\n.\\nGerald Ford\\npardoned\\nRichard Nixon\\na month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when\\nBill Clinton\\npardoned\\nPatty Hearst\\non his last day in office; this is often\\ncontroversial\\n.\\n[\\n98\\n]\\n[\\n99\\n]\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is\\nexecutive privilege\\n, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see\\nChief Justice\\nJohn Jay\\n's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain\\n. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nUnited States v. Nixon\\n, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the\\nLewinsky scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nClinton v. Jones\\n, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the\\nlegal precedent\\nthat executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nThe\\nstate secrets privilege\\nallows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from\\ndiscovery\\nin legal proceedings if such release would harm\\nnational security\\n. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when\\nThomas Jefferson\\nrefused to release military documents in the\\ntreason\\ntrial of\\nAaron Burr\\nand again in\\nTotten v. United States\\n, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHowever, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until\\nUnited States v. Reynolds\\n, where it was held to be a\\ncommon law\\nevidentiary\\nprivilege.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nBefore the\\nSeptember 11 attacks\\n, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nSince 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the\\nNinth Circuit\\n's ruling in\\nMohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nCritics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has\\nabsolute immunity\\nfrom court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions.\\nNixon v. Fitzgerald\\n(1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions.\\nClinton v. Jones\\n(1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019\\nMueller report\\non Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible\\nobstruction of justice\\n, but investigators declined to refer\\nDonald Trump\\nfor prosecution based on a\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\npolicy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy.

Many outgoing presidents since\\nJames Buchanan\\ntraditionally give advice to their successor during the\\npresidential transition\\n.\\n[\\n119\\n]\\nRonald Reagan\\nand his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on\\nInauguration Day\\nfor the incoming president.\\n[\\n120\\n]\\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration\\npublic relations\\nofficials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\\"propagandized leadership\\\" which has a \\\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\\".\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nAdministration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops\\nof smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nOne critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \\\"in rich detail\\\" which \\\"drew on the power of myth\\\" regarding the incident of\\nPT 109\\n[\\n123\\n]\\nand wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.\\n[\\n124\\n]\\nAs a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \\\"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\\\".\\n[\\n125\\n]\\nHead of party\\nThe president is typically considered to be the\\nde facto\\nhead and spokesperson of their political party.  With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party's voters.  Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The\\ncoattail effect\\n, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.  Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\nGlobal leader\\nWith the rise of the United States as a\\nsuperpower\\nin the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of\\nNATO\\n, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the\\nEuropean Union\\n, have led to the moniker that the president is the \\\"\\nleader of the free world\\n\\\".\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5\\nof the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\nbe a\\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\\n;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a\\nresident in the United States\\nfor at least 14 years.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 7\\n, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nUnder\\nSection 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment\\n, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nThere is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding\\nConfederates\\nfrom public office after the Civil War.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nUnder the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nPrior experience\\nMain articles:\\nList of presidents of the United States by other offices held\\n,\\nList of presidents of the United States by previous experience\\n, and\\nList of presidents of the United States by education\\nThere are no requirements for previous or concurrent offices held by the President or presidential candidates.

Of those,\\n16 presidents\\nreceived a Bachelor's or advanced degree from colleges in the\\nIvy League\\n.\\nCampaigns and nomination\\nMain articles:\\nUnited States presidential primary\\nand\\nUnited States presidential nominating convention\\nSee also:\\nUnited States presidential debates\\nPresident\\nJimmy Carter\\n(left) debates Republican nominee\\nRonald Reagan\\non October 28, 1980, during the\\n1980 U.S. presidential campaign\\nThe modern presidential campaign begins before the\\nprimary elections\\n, which the two major political parties use to clear the field of candidates before their\\nnational nominating conventions\\n, where the most successful candidate is made the party's presidential nominee. Typically, the party's presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee, and this choice is\\nrubber-stamped\\nby the convention.\\nNominees participate in\\nnationally televised debates\\n, and while the debates are usually restricted to the\\nDemocratic\\nand\\nRepublican\\nnominees,\\nthird party\\ncandidates may be invited, such as\\nRoss Perot\\nin the 1992 debates.

As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the\\nTwenty-third Amendment\\nprovides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.\\n[\\n136\\n]\\nCurrently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nIn all but two states, the party whose presidential\\u2013vice presidential\\nticket\\nreceives a\\nplurality\\nof popular votes in the state has its entire\\nslate\\nof elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nMaine\\nand\\nNebraska\\ndeviate from this\\nwinner-take-all\\npractice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each\\ncongressional district\\n.\\n[\\n139\\n]\\n[\\n140\\n]\\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the\\nparty\\nthat nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are\\npledged\\n.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nThe constitutionality of these laws was upheld in\\nChiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nFollowing the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an\\nabsolute majority\\nof electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the\\nHouse of Representatives\\nmust meet to elect a president using a\\ncontingent election\\nprocedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top\\nthree\\nelectoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\\u201373 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand fellow Democratic-Republican\\nAaron Burr\\nin the\\nelection of 1800\\nnecessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n3\\nof the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the\\nrunner-up\\nwould become vice president.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nOn February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the\\nTwelfth Amendment\\nin time to be used in the\\n1804 election\\n.\\n[\\n145\\n]\\nA quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the\\nelection of 1824\\n. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients:\\nAndrew Jackson\\n,\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\n, and\\nWilliam H. Crawford\\n. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.\\n[\\n146\\n]\\nInauguration\\nMain article:\\nUnited States presidential inauguration\\nPursuant to the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\n, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election.\\n[\\n147\\n]\\nThe first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as\\nInauguration Day\\n, were the\\nsecond terms\\nof President\\nFranklin D.

As a result of the date change, the first term (1933\\u201337) of both men had been shortened by 43 days.\\n[\\n149\\n]\\nBefore executing the powers of the office, a president is required to\\nrecite\\nthe\\npresidential Oath of Office\\n, found in\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n8 of the Constitution\\n. This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution:\\nI do solemnly swear (or\\naffirm\\n) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nPresidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a\\nBible\\nwhile taking the oath, and have added \\\"So help me God\\\" to the end of the oath.\\n[\\n151\\n]\\n[\\n152\\n]\\nAlthough the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the\\nchief justice of the United States\\n.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nIncumbency\\nTerm limit\\nPresident\\nWilliam McKinley\\nand his vice presidential running mate, New York Governor\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\n,\\nc.\\n1900\\nFranklin D.

Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in\\nWorld War II\\n, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nIn response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\nwas\\nadopted\\nin 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term.\\nHarry S. Truman\\n, the president at the time it was submitted to the states by the Congress, was exempted from its limitations. Without the exemption, he would not have been eligible to run for a second full term in 1952 (which he briefly sought), as he had served nearly all of Franklin Roosevelt's unexpired 1945\\u20131949 term and had been elected to a full four-year term beginning in 1949.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nVacancies and succession\\nUnder\\nSection\\n1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment\\n, ratified in 1967, the vice president becomes president upon the\\nremoval from office\\n, death, or resignation of the president. Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession),\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6\\n, stated only that the vice president assumes the \\\"powers and duties\\\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nUnder this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply\\nact\\nas president,\\n[\\n157\\n]\\npotentially resulting in a\\nspecial election\\n. Upon the death of President\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nin 1841, Vice President\\nJohn Tyler\\ndeclared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \\\"Acting President\\\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\\\".\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nThe\\nPresidential Succession Act\\nof 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C. \\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the\\npresidential line of succession\\nfollows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments\\nwho form the president's\\ncabinet\\n. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nDeclarations of inability\\nMain article:\\nTwenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes\\nacting president\\n, by transmitting to the\\nspeaker of the House\\nand the\\npresident\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate\\na statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by\\nRonald Reagan\\n(once),\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n(twice), and\\nJoe Biden\\n(once), each in anticipation of surgery.\\n[\\n159\\n]\\n[\\n160\\n]\\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment also provides that the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the\\nCabinet\\n, may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration, to the speaker of the House and the president\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate, to the effect that the president is unable to discharge his or her powers and duties.

Additionally, the\\nHouse Judiciary Committee\\nconducted an impeachment inquiry against Richard Nixon in\\n1973\\u201374\\nand reported  three articles of impeachment to the House of Representatives for final action; however, he resigned from office before the House voted on them.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nCircumvention of authority\\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the part of the president, or with a long-term disability. In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders. This has ranged from\\nRichard Nixon\\n's Chief of Staff not transmitting orders to the Cabinet due to the president's heavy drinking, to staff removing memos from\\nDonald Trump\\n's desk.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nDecades before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a\\nstroke that left him partly incapacitated\\n.

When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval.

Though the\\nFounding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from\\npolitical factions\\n, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the\\nWashington administration\\nwere referred to as \\\"pro-administration\\\" and would eventually form the\\nFederalist Party\\n, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\n.\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained\\nunaffiliated\\nwith any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.\\n[\\n196\\n]\\n[\\n197\\n]\\nSince Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office, and, since 1869, every president has been a member of either the\\nRepublican\\nor\\nDemocratic\\nParties.\\n[\\n198\\n]\\n[\\n199\\n]\\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\\nParty\\nNumber of\\npresidents\\nName(s)\\nRepublican\\n19\\nChester\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Arthur\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0H.\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nCalvin\\u00a0Coolidge\\n,\\nDwight\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Eisenhower\\n,\\nGerald\\u00a0Ford\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Garfield\\n,\\nUlysses\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Grant\\n,\\nWarren\\u00a0G.\\u00a0Harding\\n,\\nBenjamin\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nRutherford\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Hayes\\n,\\nHerbert\\u00a0Hoover\\n,\\nAbraham\\u00a0Lincoln\\n,\\n[\\nG\\n]\\nWilliam\\u00a0McKinley\\n,\\nRichard\\u00a0Nixon\\n,\\nRonald\\u00a0Reagan\\n,\\nTheodore\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Howard\\u00a0Taft\\n, and\\nDonald\\u00a0Trump\\n(incumbent)\\nDemocratic\\n15\\nJoe Biden\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Buchanan\\n,\\nJimmy\\u00a0Carter\\n,\\nGrover\\u00a0Cleveland\\n,\\nBill\\u00a0Clinton\\n,\\nAndrew\\u00a0Jackson\\n,\\nLyndon\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Johnson\\n,\\nJohn\\u00a0F.\\u00a0Kennedy\\n,\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0Pierce\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0K.\\u00a0Polk\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nHarry\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Truman\\n,\\nMartin\\u00a0Van\\u00a0Buren\\n, and\\nWoodrow\\u00a0Wilson\\nDemocratic-Republican\\n4\\nJohn\\u00a0Quincy\\u00a0Adams\\n,\\nThomas\\u00a0Jefferson\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Madison\\n, and\\nJames\\u00a0Monroe\\nWhig\\n4\\nMillard\\u00a0Fillmore\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Henry\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nZachary\\u00a0Taylor\\n, and\\nJohn\\u00a0Tyler\\n[\\nH\\n]\\nFederalist\\n1\\nJohn\\u00a0Adams\\nNational Union\\n1\\nAndrew\\u00a0Johnson\\n[\\nI\\n]\\nIndependent\\n(No party)\\n1\\nGeorge\\u00a0Washington\\nTimeline of presidents\\nSee also:\\nList of presidents of the United States\\nThe following\\ntimeline\\ndepicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.\\nSee also\\nUnited States portal\\nPolitics portal\\nOutline of American politics\\nNotes\\n^\\nIn addition to $100,000 in travel reimbursement, $19,000 for entertainment and $50,000 for additional expenses.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\n^\\nThe informal term POTUS originated in the\\nPhillips Code\\n, a shorthand method created in 1879 by\\nWalter P.

In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members.

Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act. Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and unconstitutional, and no president in the past 35 years has filed a report \\\"pursuant\\\" to these triggering provisions.\\n^\\na\\nb\\nc\\nd\\n\\\"The Law: The President's War Powers\\\"\\n.\\nTime\\n.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown. But the increase in reported cases is indicative of greater willingness to assert the privilege than in the past.\\n^\\nSavage, Charlie (September 8, 2010).\\n\\\"Court Dismisses a Case Asserting Torture by C.I.A.\\\"\\nThe New York Times\\n.

The new government did not commence until the old government expired. It is apparent that the government did not commence on the Constitution's being ratified by the ninth state, for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognized by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members. It existed potentially until March 2, the day preceding that on which the members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\\\"\\nOwings v.

The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's\\nmost expensive military\\n, which has the\\nsecond-largest nuclear arsenal\\n.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of\\nseparation of powers\\n,\\nArticle I, Section\\n7\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or\\nveto\\nfederal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is\\nelected indirectly\\nthrough the\\nElectoral College\\nto a four-year term, along with the\\nvice president\\n. Under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a\\npresident's intra-term death\\nor\\nresignation\\n.\\n[\\nC\\n]\\nIn all,\\n45 individuals\\nhave served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.\\n[\\nD\\n]\\nDonald Trump\\nis the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\nIn July 1776, the\\nThirteen Colonies\\n, represented at the\\nSecond Continental Congress\\nin\\nPhiladelphia\\n, unanimously adopted the\\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\\nin which the colonies declared themselves to be independent\\nsovereign states\\nand no longer under\\nBritish\\nrule.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe affirmation was made in the\\nDeclaration of Independence\\n, which was written predominantly by\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the\\nBritish\\n,\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nthe Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates\\ntogether. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nCongress finished work on the\\nArticles of Confederation\\nto establish a\\nperpetual union\\nbetween the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for\\nratification\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nUnder the Articles, which\\ntook effect\\non March 1, 1781, the\\nCongress of the Confederation\\nwas a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThis institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of\\nCrown\\nand\\nParliament\\nought to have functioned with respect to the royal\\ndominion\\n: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly\\nroyal prerogatives\\n(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a\\npresident of the United States in Congress Assembled\\nto preside over its deliberation as a neutral\\ndiscussion moderator\\n. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1783, the\\nTreaty of Paris\\nsecured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nBy 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their\\nhard currency\\npouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their\\nMediterranean\\ncommerce preyed upon by\\nNorth African\\npirates\\n, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nCivil and political unrest loomed.  Events such as the\\nNewburgh Conspiracy\\nand\\nShays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between\\nVirginia\\nand Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference\\nin 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in\\nAnnapolis, Maryland\\n, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the\\nconvention\\nfailed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states,\\nAlexander Hamilton\\nof New York led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in\\nPhiladelphia\\n.

Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nNew York\\noffered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIt was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the\\nU.S. Constitution\\nemerged.\\n1789\\u20131933\\nGeorge Washington\\n, the first president of the United States\\nAs the nation's first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\nestablished many norms that would come to define the office.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nHis decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the\\nTwenty-Second Amendment\\n.

Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nPresident\\nLyndon B. Johnson\\nsigns the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act\\nat the\\nWhite House\\non July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\nand others look on.\\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the\\nPresentment Clause\\n, which gives the president the power to veto any\\nbill\\npassed by\\nCongress\\n. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\nof both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.  The veto \\u2013 or threat of a veto \\u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\nSign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill\\nbecomes law\\n.\\nVeto\\nthe legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\n.\\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto\\n.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the\\nLine Item Veto Act\\n. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In\\nClinton v. City of New York\\n,\\n524\\nU.S.\\n417\\n(1998), the\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nSetting the agenda\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump\\ndelivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore\\nCongress\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \\\"necessary and expedient\\\". This is done through the constitutionally-based\\nState of the Union\\naddress, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nPresidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of\\nagencies\\nthat can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\\"virtual army of 'czars'\\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\\".\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nPresidents have been criticized for making\\nsigning statements\\nwhen signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nThis practice has been criticized by the\\nAmerican Bar Association\\nas unconstitutional.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nConservative commentator\\nGeorge Will\\nwrote of an \\\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\\" and \\\"the eclipse of Congress\\\".\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by\\nArticle II, Section\\n3\\nof the Constitution to call a\\nspecial session\\nof one or both houses of Congress. Since\\nJohn Adams\\nfirst did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions.\\nHarry S. Truman\\nwas the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the\\nTurnip Day Session\\n. In addition, prior to ratification of the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\nin 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly\\ninaugurated\\npresidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nExecutive powers\\nMain article:\\nPowers of the president of the United States\\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

When the president is lawfully exercising one of the constitutionally conferred presidential responsibilities, the scope of this power is broad.\\n[\\n82\\n]\\nEven so, these directives are subject to\\njudicial review\\nby U.S. federal courts, which can find them to be unconstitutional.

The first is\\nexecutive privilege\\n, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see\\nChief Justice\\nJohn Jay\\n's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain\\n. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nUnited States v. Nixon\\n, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the\\nLewinsky scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nClinton v. Jones\\n, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the\\nlegal precedent\\nthat executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nThe\\nstate secrets privilege\\nallows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from\\ndiscovery\\nin legal proceedings if such release would harm\\nnational security\\n. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when\\nThomas Jefferson\\nrefused to release military documents in the\\ntreason\\ntrial of\\nAaron Burr\\nand again in\\nTotten v. United States\\n, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHowever, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until\\nUnited States v. Reynolds\\n, where it was held to be a\\ncommon law\\nevidentiary\\nprivilege.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nBefore the\\nSeptember 11 attacks\\n, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nSince 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the\\nNinth Circuit\\n's ruling in\\nMohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nCritics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has\\nabsolute immunity\\nfrom court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions.\\nNixon v. Fitzgerald\\n(1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions.\\nClinton v. Jones\\n(1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019\\nMueller report\\non Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible\\nobstruction of justice\\n, but investigators declined to refer\\nDonald Trump\\nfor prosecution based on a\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\npolicy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy. As of October 2019, a case was pending in the federal courts regarding access to personal tax returns in a criminal case brought against Donald Trump by the\\nNew York County District Attorney\\nalleging violations of New York state law.\\n[\\n109\\n]\\nMemoranda from the\\nOffice of Legal Counsel\\nissued in 1973 and 2000 internally prohibit the Department of Justice from prosecuting a president, which some legal scholars have criticized but others have endorsed.\\n[\\n110\\n]\\nIn defense against federal criminal prosecution for his\\nalleged 2020 election subversion\\n, in January 2024, Trump argued to the\\nDC Circuit Court of Appeals\\nthat a president enjoys absolute immunity for criminal acts conducted while in office. The next month, a three-judge panel of the court unanimously ruled against Trump. It was the first time an appeals court had addressed such a presidential immunity matter, since no other sitting or former president had ever been criminally indicted.\\n[\\n111\\n]\\nIn\\nTrump v. United States\\n, on July 1, 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents were entitled to absolute immunity from exercising core powers enumerated by the Constitution,\\npresumption\\nof immunity for other official acts, and no immunity for unofficial actions. The case was sent back to lower courts to determine which actions in the criminal complaint should be classified as official vs. unofficial.\\n[\\n112\\n]\\nThe ruling was the first time the courts granted a president criminal immunity.\\nLeadership roles\\nHead of state\\nFour ruffles and flourishes and 'Hail to the Chief' (long version)\\nProblems playing this file? See\\nmedia help\\n.\\nAs\\nhead of state\\n, the president represents the United States government to its own people and represents the nation to the rest of the world. For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a\\nState Arrival Ceremony\\nheld on the\\nSouth Lawn\\n, a custom begun by\\nJohn F. Kennedy\\nin 1961.\\n[\\n113\\n]\\nThis is followed by a\\nstate dinner\\ngiven by the president which is held in the\\nState Dining Room\\nlater in the evening.\\n[\\n114\\n]\\nPresident\\nWoodrow Wilson\\nthrows out the ceremonial first ball on\\nOpening Day\\nin 1916\\nPresident\\nBill Clinton\\nreviews honor guards at\\nBuckingham Palace\\nduring a 1995 state visit to the UK\\nAs a national leader, the president also fulfills many less formal ceremonial duties. For example,\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\nstarted the tradition of throwing out the\\nceremonial first pitch\\nin 1910 at\\nGriffith Stadium\\n, Washington, D.C., on the\\nWashington Senators's\\nOpening Day\\n. Every president since Taft, except for\\nJimmy Carter\\n, threw out at least one ceremonial first ball or pitch for Opening Day, the\\nAll-Star Game\\n, or the\\nWorld Series\\n, usually with much fanfare.\\n[\\n115\\n]\\nEvery president since\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\nhas served as honorary president of the\\nBoy Scouts of America\\n.\\n[\\n116\\n]\\nOther presidential traditions are associated with American holidays.\\nRutherford B.

Since 1989, when the custom of \\\"pardoning\\\" the turkey was formalized by\\nGeorge H. W. Bush\\n, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.\\n[\\n118\\n]\\nPresidential traditions also involve the president's role as head of government. Many outgoing presidents since\\nJames Buchanan\\ntraditionally give advice to their successor during the\\npresidential transition\\n.\\n[\\n119\\n]\\nRonald Reagan\\nand his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on\\nInauguration Day\\nfor the incoming president.\\n[\\n120\\n]\\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration\\npublic relations\\nofficials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\\"propagandized leadership\\\" which has a \\\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\\".\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nAdministration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops\\nof smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nOne critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \\\"in rich detail\\\" which \\\"drew on the power of myth\\\" regarding the incident of\\nPT 109\\n[\\n123\\n]\\nand wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.\\n[\\n124\\n]\\nAs a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \\\"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\\\".\\n[\\n125\\n]\\nHead of party\\nThe president is typically considered to be the\\nde facto\\nhead and spokesperson of their political party.  With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party's voters.  Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The\\ncoattail effect\\n, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.  Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\nGlobal leader\\nWith the rise of the United States as a\\nsuperpower\\nin the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of\\nNATO\\n, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the\\nEuropean Union\\n, have led to the moniker that the president is the \\\"\\nleader of the free world\\n\\\".\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5\\nof the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\nbe a\\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\\n;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a\\nresident in the United States\\nfor at least 14 years.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 7\\n, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nUnder\\nSection 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment\\n, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nThere is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding\\nConfederates\\nfrom public office after the Civil War.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nUnder the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nPrior experience\\nMain articles:\\nList of presidents of the United States by other offices held\\n,\\nList of presidents of the United States by previous experience\\n, and\\nList of presidents of the United States by education\\nThere are no requirements for previous or concurrent offices held by the President or presidential candidates.

There has never been a property qualification for the Presidency or other federal offices, but, in the early years of the republic, there were\\nproperty qualifications for voting\\nor for some of the stepping-stone offices to the Presidency (particularly governorships).  Prior to the Civil War, it was common for presidents to be men of significant property: Presidents from the North tended to own small farms, while several Southern presidents owned plantations and\\nslaves\\n.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n[\\n135\\n]\\nWhile several later presidents came from abject poverty, others, such as the Roosevelts, John Kennedy, and Donald Trump, were parties to extensive family fortunes.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n33 of the 45 men who served as President, including every president since 1953 and all but one since 1901, have had a bachelor's degree.

As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the\\nTwenty-third Amendment\\nprovides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.\\n[\\n136\\n]\\nCurrently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nIn all but two states, the party whose presidential\\u2013vice presidential\\nticket\\nreceives a\\nplurality\\nof popular votes in the state has its entire\\nslate\\nof elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nMaine\\nand\\nNebraska\\ndeviate from this\\nwinner-take-all\\npractice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each\\ncongressional district\\n.\\n[\\n139\\n]\\n[\\n140\\n]\\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the\\nparty\\nthat nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are\\npledged\\n.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nThe constitutionality of these laws was upheld in\\nChiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nFollowing the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an\\nabsolute majority\\nof electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the\\nHouse of Representatives\\nmust meet to elect a president using a\\ncontingent election\\nprocedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top\\nthree\\nelectoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\\u201373 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand fellow Democratic-Republican\\nAaron Burr\\nin the\\nelection of 1800\\nnecessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n3\\nof the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the\\nrunner-up\\nwould become vice president.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nOn February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the\\nTwelfth Amendment\\nin time to be used in the\\n1804 election\\n.\\n[\\n145\\n]\\nA quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the\\nelection of 1824\\n. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients:\\nAndrew Jackson\\n,\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\n, and\\nWilliam H. Crawford\\n. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.\\n[\\n146\\n]\\nInauguration\\nMain article:\\nUnited States presidential inauguration\\nPursuant to the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\n, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election.\\n[\\n147\\n]\\nThe first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as\\nInauguration Day\\n, were the\\nsecond terms\\nof President\\nFranklin D.

Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession),\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6\\n, stated only that the vice president assumes the \\\"powers and duties\\\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nUnder this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply\\nact\\nas president,\\n[\\n157\\n]\\npotentially resulting in a\\nspecial election\\n. Upon the death of President\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nin 1841, Vice President\\nJohn Tyler\\ndeclared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \\\"Acting President\\\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\\\".\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nThe\\nPresidential Succession Act\\nof 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C. \\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the\\npresidential line of succession\\nfollows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments\\nwho form the president's\\ncabinet\\n. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nDeclarations of inability\\nMain article:\\nTwenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes\\nacting president\\n, by transmitting to the\\nspeaker of the House\\nand the\\npresident\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate\\na statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by\\nRonald Reagan\\n(once),\\nGeorge W.

In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the\\nBoeing C-32\\n, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet. Any civilian aircraft the president is aboard is designated\\nExecutive One\\nfor the flight.\\n[\\n172\\n]\\nFor short-distance air travel, the president has access to a fleet of\\nU.S. Marine Corps\\nhelicopters of varying models, designated\\nMarine One\\nwhen the president is aboard any particular one in the fleet.

Prominent examples include\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\n's tenure as\\nchief justice of the United States\\nand\\nHerbert Hoover\\n's work on government reorganization after\\nWorld War II\\n. Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House:\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwas elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for 17 years, and\\nAndrew Johnson\\nreturned to the Senate in 1875, though he died soon after. Some ex-presidents were very active, especially in international affairs, most notably Theodore Roosevelt;\\n[\\n178\\n]\\nHerbert Hoover;\\n[\\n179\\n]\\nRichard Nixon;\\n[\\n180\\n]\\nand Jimmy Carter.\\n[\\n181\\n]\\n[\\n182\\n]\\nEarlier presidents returned to their hometowns to lead charitable work there, or supervised farm work on their farms or plantations, many of which had been neglected during their presidencies.\\nThomas Jefferson\\nfounded the\\nUniversity of Virginia\\nduring his post-presidency, and, following his death, was succeeded as rector by\\nJames Madison\\n.  Madison and\\nJames Monroe\\nparticipated in the drafting of one version of the\\nVirginia Constitution\\n, while\\nJohn Tyler\\nserved at the Confederate Constitution and in the Confederate Congress.\\nPresidents may use their predecessors as emissaries to deliver private messages to other nations or as official representatives of the United States to state funerals and other important foreign events.\\n[\\n183\\n]\\n[\\n184\\n]\\nRichard Nixon made multiple foreign trips to countries including China and Russia and was lauded as an elder statesman.\\n[\\n185\\n]\\nDuring his post-presidency\\n,\\nJimmy Carter\\nbecame a global\\nhuman rights\\ncampaigner, international arbiter, and election monitor, as well as a recipient of the\\nNobel Peace Prize\\n. Bill Clinton also worked as an informal ambassador, most recently in the negotiations that led to the release of two American\\njournalists\\n,\\nLaura Ling\\nand\\nEuna Lee\\n, from\\nNorth Korea\\n. During his presidency, George W. Bush called on former presidents George H. W. Bush and Clinton to assist with humanitarian efforts after the\\n2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami\\n. President Obama followed suit by asking presidents Clinton and George W. Bush to lead efforts to aid Haiti after an\\nearthquake\\ndevastated that country in 2010.  Clinton's relationship with the two Bushes is not the first friendship between former presidents: Carter enjoyed a friendship and correspondence with\\nGerald Ford\\n, while Jefferson and\\nJohn Adams\\nhad an extended correspondence through letters in their post-presidencies.\\nClinton has been active politically since his presidential term ended\\n, working with his wife\\nHillary\\non her\\n2008\\nand\\n2016\\npresidential bids and President Obama on his\\n2012 reelection campaign\\n. Obama has also been active politically since his presidential term ended, having worked with his former vice president\\nJoe Biden\\non his\\n2020 election campaign\\nand Biden's vice president\\nKamala Harris\\non her\\n2024 election campaign\\nafter President Biden\\nwithdrew his bid for re-election\\n.\\nAfter losing his bid for the presidency in 2020, Trump remained politically active and was an outspoken critic of his successor and the Democratic Party. He also contended with four criminal cases. Trump announced his fourth bid to the presidency in 2022, ultimately becoming the nominee of his party for the third time and won a second presidential term in 2024.\\nGrover Cleveland\\nwas also elected to nonconsecutive terms; his reelection bid failed in\\n1888\\nbut succeeded in\\n1892\\n.\\nPension and other benefits\\nThe\\nFormer Presidents Act\\n(FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection; also provided is funding for a certain number of staff and for office expenses.  The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff.  The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by\\nimpeachment\\n.\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nAccording to a 2008 report by the\\nCongressional Research Service\\n:\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nChief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nFormer presidents who served in Congress may also collect\\ncongressional pensions\\n.\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nThe act also provides former presidents with travel funds and\\nfranking\\nprivileges.\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.\\n[\\n189\\n]\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nIn 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nOn January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him,\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n, and all subsequent presidents.\\n[\\n192\\n]\\nA\\nfirst spouse\\nwho remarries is no longer eligible for Secret Service protection.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nWriting\\nMain article:\\nList of autobiographies by presidents of the United States\\nSince the publication of\\nUlysses S. Grant\\n's\\nPersonal Memoirs\\nin 1885, most presidents, including every president who survived to the end of their term from Calvin Coolidge to Barack Obama, has written at least one autobiography.  These autobiographies serve two purposes: to ensure the First Family's financial security (Clinton made over $30 million dollars from writing two books\\n[\\n193\\n]\\n), but also to defend or rehabilitate presidential legacies.\\nPresidential libraries and historic sites\\nMain articles:\\nPresidential library system\\nand\\nList of residences of presidents of the United States\\nThe homes where U.S. presidents were born, lived or vacationed have frequently been preserved as\\nhouse museums\\nand listed as\\nNational Historic Sites\\nor on\\nU.S. National Register of Historic Places\\n.\\nFrom left to right: Presidents\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nGeorge W.

Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the\\nNational Archives and Records Administration\\n(NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.\\n[\\n194\\n]\\nThere are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, including:\\nThe\\nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the State of\\nIllinois\\n;\\nThe\\nGeorge W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by\\nSouthern Methodist University\\n;\\nThe\\nGeorge H. W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by\\nTexas A&M University\\n; and\\nThe\\nLyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the\\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\\n.\\nSeveral former presidents have overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document:\\nThe\\nHarry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nIndependence, Missouri\\n;\\nThe\\nDwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home\\nin\\nAbilene, Kansas\\n;\\nThe\\nRichard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nYorba Linda, California\\n; and\\nThe\\nRonald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nSimi Valley, California\\n.\\nThese gravesites are open to the general public.  In some cases (such as with Nixon), the presidential library is adjacent to one of the president's former homes, where in other cases, such as with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, the presidential library and the historic site are in different cities entirely.\\nPolitical affiliation\\nPolitical parties\\nhave dominated\\nAmerican politics\\nfor most of the nation's history. Though the\\nFounding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from\\npolitical factions\\n, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the\\nWashington administration\\nwere referred to as \\\"pro-administration\\\" and would eventually form the\\nFederalist Party\\n, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\n.\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained\\nunaffiliated\\nwith any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.\\n[\\n196\\n]\\n[\\n197\\n]\\nSince Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office, and, since 1869, every president has been a member of either the\\nRepublican\\nor\\nDemocratic\\nParties.\\n[\\n198\\n]\\n[\\n199\\n]\\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\\nParty\\nNumber of\\npresidents\\nName(s)\\nRepublican\\n19\\nChester\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Arthur\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0H.\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nCalvin\\u00a0Coolidge\\n,\\nDwight\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Eisenhower\\n,\\nGerald\\u00a0Ford\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Garfield\\n,\\nUlysses\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Grant\\n,\\nWarren\\u00a0G.\\u00a0Harding\\n,\\nBenjamin\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nRutherford\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Hayes\\n,\\nHerbert\\u00a0Hoover\\n,\\nAbraham\\u00a0Lincoln\\n,\\n[\\nG\\n]\\nWilliam\\u00a0McKinley\\n,\\nRichard\\u00a0Nixon\\n,\\nRonald\\u00a0Reagan\\n,\\nTheodore\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Howard\\u00a0Taft\\n, and\\nDonald\\u00a0Trump\\n(incumbent)\\nDemocratic\\n15\\nJoe Biden\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Buchanan\\n,\\nJimmy\\u00a0Carter\\n,\\nGrover\\u00a0Cleveland\\n,\\nBill\\u00a0Clinton\\n,\\nAndrew\\u00a0Jackson\\n,\\nLyndon\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Johnson\\n,\\nJohn\\u00a0F.\\u00a0Kennedy\\n,\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0Pierce\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0K.\\u00a0Polk\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nHarry\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Truman\\n,\\nMartin\\u00a0Van\\u00a0Buren\\n, and\\nWoodrow\\u00a0Wilson\\nDemocratic-Republican\\n4\\nJohn\\u00a0Quincy\\u00a0Adams\\n,\\nThomas\\u00a0Jefferson\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Madison\\n, and\\nJames\\u00a0Monroe\\nWhig\\n4\\nMillard\\u00a0Fillmore\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Henry\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nZachary\\u00a0Taylor\\n, and\\nJohn\\u00a0Tyler\\n[\\nH\\n]\\nFederalist\\n1\\nJohn\\u00a0Adams\\nNational Union\\n1\\nAndrew\\u00a0Johnson\\n[\\nI\\n]\\nIndependent\\n(No party)\\n1\\nGeorge\\u00a0Washington\\nTimeline of presidents\\nSee also:\\nList of presidents of the United States\\nThe following\\ntimeline\\ndepicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.\\nSee also\\nUnited States portal\\nPolitics portal\\nOutline of American politics\\nNotes\\n^\\nIn addition to $100,000 in travel reimbursement, $19,000 for entertainment and $50,000 for additional expenses.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\n^\\nThe informal term POTUS originated in the\\nPhillips Code\\n, a shorthand method created in 1879 by\\nWalter P.

Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

The new government did not commence until the old government expired.

In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members. It existed potentially until March 2, the day preceding that on which the members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\\\"\\nOwings v.

The president directs the\\nexecutive branch\\nof the\\nfederal government\\nand is the\\ncommander-in-chief\\nof the\\nUnited States Armed Forces\\n.\\nThe power of the presidency has grown\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nsince the first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\n, took office in 1789.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nWhile presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasing role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with some expansions during the presidencies of\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nand\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining\\nsuperpower\\n.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nAs the leader of the nation with the\\nlargest economy by nominal GDP\\n, the president possesses significant domestic and international\\nhard\\nand\\nsoft power\\n. For much of the 20th century, especially during the\\nCold War\\n, the U.S. president was often called \\\"the leader of the free world\\\".\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nArticle II of the Constitution\\nestablishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's\\nmost expensive military\\n, which has the\\nsecond-largest nuclear arsenal\\n.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of\\nseparation of powers\\n,\\nArticle I, Section\\n7\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or\\nveto\\nfederal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is\\nelected indirectly\\nthrough the\\nElectoral College\\nto a four-year term, along with the\\nvice president\\n. Under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a\\npresident's intra-term death\\nor\\nresignation\\n.\\n[\\nC\\n]\\nIn all,\\n45 individuals\\nhave served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.\\n[\\nD\\n]\\nDonald Trump\\nis the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\nIn July 1776, the\\nThirteen Colonies\\n, represented at the\\nSecond Continental Congress\\nin\\nPhiladelphia\\n, unanimously adopted the\\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\\nin which the colonies declared themselves to be independent\\nsovereign states\\nand no longer under\\nBritish\\nrule.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe affirmation was made in the\\nDeclaration of Independence\\n, which was written predominantly by\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the\\nBritish\\n,\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nthe Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates\\ntogether. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nCongress finished work on the\\nArticles of Confederation\\nto establish a\\nperpetual union\\nbetween the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for\\nratification\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nUnder the Articles, which\\ntook effect\\non March 1, 1781, the\\nCongress of the Confederation\\nwas a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThis institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of\\nCrown\\nand\\nParliament\\nought to have functioned with respect to the royal\\ndominion\\n: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly\\nroyal prerogatives\\n(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a\\npresident of the United States in Congress Assembled\\nto preside over its deliberation as a neutral\\ndiscussion moderator\\n. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1783, the\\nTreaty of Paris\\nsecured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nBy 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their\\nhard currency\\npouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their\\nMediterranean\\ncommerce preyed upon by\\nNorth African\\npirates\\n, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nCivil and political unrest loomed.  Events such as the\\nNewburgh Conspiracy\\nand\\nShays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between\\nVirginia\\nand Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference\\nin 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in\\nAnnapolis, Maryland\\n, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the\\nconvention\\nfailed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states,\\nAlexander Hamilton\\nof New York led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in\\nPhiladelphia\\n. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nEdmund Randolph\\nsucceeded in securing\\nGeorge Washington\\n's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nWhen the\\nConstitutional Convention\\nconvened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (\\nRhode Island\\ndid not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nNew York\\noffered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIt was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the\\nU.S. Constitution\\nemerged.\\n1789\\u20131933\\nGeorge Washington\\n, the first president of the United States\\nAs the nation's first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\nestablished many norms that would come to define the office.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nHis decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the\\nTwenty-Second Amendment\\n. By the end of his presidency, political parties had developed,\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nwith\\nJohn Adams\\ndefeating\\nThomas Jefferson\\nin 1796, the first truly contested presidential election.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nAfter Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow Virginians\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nJames Monroe\\nwould each serve two terms, eventually dominating the nation's politics during the\\nEra of Good Feelings\\nuntil Adams' son\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwon election in 1824 after the\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\nsplit.\\nThe election of\\nAndrew Jackson\\nin 1828 was a significant milestone, as Jackson was not part of the Virginia and Massachusetts elite that had held the presidency for its first 40 years.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nJacksonian democracy\\nsought to strengthen the presidency at the expense of Congress, while broadening public participation as the nation rapidly expanded westward. However, his successor,\\nMartin Van Buren\\n, became unpopular after the\\nPanic of 1837\\n,\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nand the death of\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nand subsequent poor relations between\\nJohn Tyler\\nand Congress led to further weakening of the office.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nIncluding Van Buren, in the 24 years between 1837 and 1861, six presidential terms would be filled by eight different men, with none serving two terms.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nThe Senate played an important role during this period, with the\\nGreat Triumvirate\\nof\\nHenry Clay\\n,\\nDaniel Webster\\n, and\\nJohn C. Calhoun\\nplaying key roles in shaping national policy in the 1830s and 1840s until debates over slavery began pulling the nation apart in the 1850s.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nAbraham Lincoln\\n's leadership during the\\nCivil War\\nhas led historians to regard him as one of the nation's greatest presidents.\\n[\\nE\\n]\\nThe circumstances of the war and Republican domination of Congress made the office very powerful,\\n[\\n37\\n]\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nand Lincoln's re-election in 1864 was the first time a president had been re-elected since Jackson in 1832. After Lincoln's assassination, his successor\\nAndrew Johnson\\nlost all political support\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nand was nearly removed from office,\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nwith Congress remaining powerful during the two-term presidency of Civil War general\\nUlysses S. Grant\\n. After the end of\\nReconstruction\\n,\\nGrover Cleveland\\nwould eventually become the first Democratic president elected since before the war, running in three consecutive elections (1884, 1888, 1892) and winning twice. In 1900,\\nWilliam McKinley\\nbecame the first incumbent to win re-election since Grant in 1872.\\nAfter McKinley's\\nassassination\\nby\\nLeon Czolgosz\\nin 1901,\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\nbecame a dominant figure in American politics.\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nHistorians believe Roosevelt permanently changed the political system by strengthening the presidency,\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nwith some key accomplishments including breaking up trusts, conservationism, labor reforms, making personal character as important as the issues, and hand-picking his successor,\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\n. The following decade,\\nWoodrow Wilson\\nled the nation to victory during\\nWorld War I\\n, although Wilson's proposal for the\\nLeague of Nations\\nwas rejected by the Senate.\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nWarren Harding\\n, while popular in office, would see his legacy tarnished by scandals, especially\\nTeapot Dome\\n,\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nand\\nHerbert Hoover\\nquickly became very unpopular after failing to alleviate the\\nGreat Depression\\n.\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nImperial presidency\\nMain article:\\nImperial presidency\\nPresident\\nFranklin D.

Johnson\\nlost popular support due to the\\nVietnam War\\nand\\nRichard Nixon\\n's presidency collapsed in the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, Congress enacted a series of reforms intended to reassert itself.\\n[\\n50\\n]\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nThese included the\\nWar Powers Resolution\\n, enacted over Nixon's veto in 1973,\\n[\\n52\\n]\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nand the\\nCongressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974\\nthat sought to strengthen congressional fiscal powers.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nBy 1976,\\nGerald Ford\\nconceded that \\\"the historic pendulum\\\" had swung toward Congress, raising the possibility of a \\\"disruptive\\\" erosion of his ability to govern.\\n[\\n55\\n]\\nFord failed to win election to a full term and his successor,\\nJimmy Carter\\n, failed to win re-election.\\nRonald Reagan\\n, who had been an actor before beginning his political career, used his talent as a communicator to help reshape the American agenda away from New Deal policies toward more conservative ideology.\\n[\\n56\\n]\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nAfter the Cold War, the United States became the world's undisputed leading power.\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nBill Clinton\\n,\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n, and\\nBarack Obama\\neach served two terms as president. Meanwhile, the nation gradually became more politically polarized, leading to the ascendency of increasingly polarized Congressmembers, especially following the\\n1994 mid-term elections\\nwhich saw Republicans control the House for the first time in 40 years, and the rise of routine\\nfilibusters\\nin the Senate.\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nRecent presidents have thus increasingly focused on\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to implement major policies, at the expense of legislation and congressional power.\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nPresidential elections in the 21st century have reflected this continuing polarization, with no candidate except Obama in 2008 winning by more than five percent of the popular vote and two, George W. Bush (\\n2000\\n) and\\nDonald Trump\\n(\\n2016\\n), winning in the Electoral College while losing the popular vote.\\n[\\nF\\n]\\nBush (\\n2004\\n) and Trump (\\n2024\\n) were later re-elected, winning both in the Electoral College and the popular vote.\\nCritics of presidency's evolution\\nThe nation's\\nFounding Fathers\\nexpected the\\nCongress\\n, which was the first branch of government described in the\\nConstitution\\n, to be the dominant branch of government; they did not expect a strong executive department.\\n[\\n61\\n]\\nHowever, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful,\\n[\\n62\\n]\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nunchecked, unbalanced,\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nand \\\"monarchist\\\" in nature.\\n[\\n65\\n]\\nIn 2008 professor\\nDana D. Nelson\\nexpressed belief that presidents over the previous thirty years worked towards \\\"undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies\\\".\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nShe criticized proponents of the\\nunitary executive theory\\nfor expanding \\\"the many existing uncheckable executive powers\\u2014such as executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements\\u2014that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid, interference or consent from Congress\\\".\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nBill Wilson\\n, board member of\\nAmericans for Limited Government\\n, opined that the expanded presidency was \\\"the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule\\\".\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nLegislative powers\\nArticle I, Section\\n1\\nof the Constitution vests all\\nlawmaking power\\nin Congress's hands, and\\nArticle 1, Section 6, Clause\\n2\\nprevents the president (and all other executive branch officers) from simultaneously being a member of Congress. Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nPresident\\nLyndon B. Johnson\\nsigns the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act\\nat the\\nWhite House\\non July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\nand others look on.\\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the\\nPresentment Clause\\n, which gives the president the power to veto any\\nbill\\npassed by\\nCongress\\n. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\nof both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.  The veto \\u2013 or threat of a veto \\u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\nSign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill\\nbecomes law\\n.\\nVeto\\nthe legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\n.\\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto\\n.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the\\nLine Item Veto Act\\n. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In\\nClinton v. City of New York\\n,\\n524\\nU.S.\\n417\\n(1998), the\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nSetting the agenda\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump\\ndelivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore\\nCongress\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \\\"necessary and expedient\\\". This is done through the constitutionally-based\\nState of the Union\\naddress, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nPresidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of\\nagencies\\nthat can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\\"virtual army of 'czars'\\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\\".\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nPresidents have been criticized for making\\nsigning statements\\nwhen signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nThis practice has been criticized by the\\nAmerican Bar Association\\nas unconstitutional.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nConservative commentator\\nGeorge Will\\nwrote of an \\\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\\" and \\\"the eclipse of Congress\\\".\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by\\nArticle II, Section\\n3\\nof the Constitution to call a\\nspecial session\\nof one or both houses of Congress. Since\\nJohn Adams\\nfirst did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions.\\nHarry S. Truman\\nwas the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the\\nTurnip Day Session\\n. In addition, prior to ratification of the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\nin 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly\\ninaugurated\\npresidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nExecutive powers\\nMain article:\\nPowers of the president of the United States\\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

However, these nominations require\\nSenate confirmation\\nbefore they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to\\nU.S. district courts\\n, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of\\nsenatorial courtesy\\n. Presidents may also grant\\npardons\\nand\\nreprieves\\n.\\nGerald Ford\\npardoned\\nRichard Nixon\\na month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when\\nBill Clinton\\npardoned\\nPatty Hearst\\non his last day in office; this is often\\ncontroversial\\n.\\n[\\n98\\n]\\n[\\n99\\n]\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is\\nexecutive privilege\\n, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see\\nChief Justice\\nJohn Jay\\n's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain\\n. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nUnited States v. Nixon\\n, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the\\nLewinsky scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nClinton v. Jones\\n, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the\\nlegal precedent\\nthat executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nThe\\nstate secrets privilege\\nallows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from\\ndiscovery\\nin legal proceedings if such release would harm\\nnational security\\n. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when\\nThomas Jefferson\\nrefused to release military documents in the\\ntreason\\ntrial of\\nAaron Burr\\nand again in\\nTotten v. United States\\n, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHowever, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until\\nUnited States v. Reynolds\\n, where it was held to be a\\ncommon law\\nevidentiary\\nprivilege.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nBefore the\\nSeptember 11 attacks\\n, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nSince 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the\\nNinth Circuit\\n's ruling in\\nMohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nCritics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has\\nabsolute immunity\\nfrom court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions.\\nNixon v. Fitzgerald\\n(1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions.\\nClinton v. Jones\\n(1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019\\nMueller report\\non Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible\\nobstruction of justice\\n, but investigators declined to refer\\nDonald Trump\\nfor prosecution based on a\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\npolicy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy.

Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration\\npublic relations\\nofficials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\\"propagandized leadership\\\" which has a \\\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\\".\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nAdministration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops\\nof smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nOne critic wrote the image of John F.

With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party's voters.  Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The\\ncoattail effect\\n, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.  Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\nGlobal leader\\nWith the rise of the United States as a\\nsuperpower\\nin the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of\\nNATO\\n, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the\\nEuropean Union\\n, have led to the moniker that the president is the \\\"\\nleader of the free world\\n\\\".\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5\\nof the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\nbe a\\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\\n;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a\\nresident in the United States\\nfor at least 14 years.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 7\\n, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nUnder\\nSection 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment\\n, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nThere is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding\\nConfederates\\nfrom public office after the Civil War.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nUnder the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nPrior experience\\nMain articles:\\nList of presidents of the United States by other offices held\\n,\\nList of presidents of the United States by previous experience\\n, and\\nList of presidents of the United States by education\\nThere are no requirements for previous or concurrent offices held by the President or presidential candidates.

They typically vote for the candidates of the\\nparty\\nthat nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are\\npledged\\n.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nThe constitutionality of these laws was upheld in\\nChiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nFollowing the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an\\nabsolute majority\\nof electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the\\nHouse of Representatives\\nmust meet to elect a president using a\\ncontingent election\\nprocedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top\\nthree\\nelectoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\\u201373 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand fellow Democratic-Republican\\nAaron Burr\\nin the\\nelection of 1800\\nnecessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n3\\nof the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the\\nrunner-up\\nwould become vice president.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nOn February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president.

This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution:\\nI do solemnly swear (or\\naffirm\\n) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nPresidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a\\nBible\\nwhile taking the oath, and have added \\\"So help me God\\\" to the end of the oath.\\n[\\n151\\n]\\n[\\n152\\n]\\nAlthough the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the\\nchief justice of the United States\\n.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nIncumbency\\nTerm limit\\nPresident\\nWilliam McKinley\\nand his vice presidential running mate, New York Governor\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\n,\\nc.\\n1900\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nwon a record four\\npresidential elections\\nin\\n1932\\n,\\n1936\\n,\\n1940\\n, and\\n1944\\nprior to the implementation of the\\n22nd amendment\\nin 1951, which instituted a two-term limit.\\nWhen the first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\n, announced in his\\nFarewell Address\\nthat he was not running for a third term, he established a \\\"two terms then out\\\" precedent. Precedent became tradition after\\nThomas Jefferson\\npublicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors,\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nJames Monroe\\n.\\n[\\n153\\n]\\nIn spite of the strong two-term tradition,\\nUlysses S. Grant\\nsought nomination at the\\n1880 Republican National Convention\\nfor a non-consecutive third term, but was unsuccessful.\\n[\\n154\\n]\\nIn 1940, after leading the nation through the\\nGreat Depression\\nand focused on supporting U.S.\\nallied nations\\nat war with the\\nAxis powers\\n, Franklin Roosevelt was elected to a third term, breaking the long-standing precedent. Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in\\nWorld War II\\n, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nIn response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\nwas\\nadopted\\nin 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term.\\nHarry S. Truman\\n, the president at the time it was submitted to the states by the Congress, was exempted from its limitations. Without the exemption, he would not have been eligible to run for a second full term in 1952 (which he briefly sought), as he had served nearly all of Franklin Roosevelt's unexpired 1945\\u20131949 term and had been elected to a full four-year term beginning in 1949.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nVacancies and succession\\nUnder\\nSection\\n1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment\\n, ratified in 1967, the vice president becomes president upon the\\nremoval from office\\n, death, or resignation of the president. Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession),\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6\\n, stated only that the vice president assumes the \\\"powers and duties\\\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nUnder this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply\\nact\\nas president,\\n[\\n157\\n]\\npotentially resulting in a\\nspecial election\\n. Upon the death of President\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nin 1841, Vice President\\nJohn Tyler\\ndeclared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \\\"Acting President\\\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\\\".\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nThe\\nPresidential Succession Act\\nof 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C. \\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the\\npresidential line of succession\\nfollows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments\\nwho form the president's\\ncabinet\\n. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nDeclarations of inability\\nMain article:\\nTwenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes\\nacting president\\n, by transmitting to the\\nspeaker of the House\\nand the\\npresident\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate\\na statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by\\nRonald Reagan\\n(once),\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n(twice), and\\nJoe Biden\\n(once), each in anticipation of surgery.\\n[\\n159\\n]\\n[\\n160\\n]\\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment also provides that the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the\\nCabinet\\n, may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration, to the speaker of the House and the president\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate, to the effect that the president is unable to discharge his or her powers and duties. If the president then declares that no such inability exist, he or she resumes the presidential powers unless the vice president and Cabinet make a second declaration of presidential inability, in which case Congress decides the question.\\nRemoval\\nMain articles:\\nList of efforts to impeach presidents of the United States\\n,\\nFederal impeachment in the United States\\n, and\\nFederal impeachment trial in the United States\\nArticle II, Section 4\\nof the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \\\"\\ntreason\\n,\\nbribery\\n, or other\\nhigh crimes and misdemeanors\\n\\\".\\nArticle I, Section 2, Clause\\n5\\nauthorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a \\\"\\ngrand jury\\n\\\" with the power to impeach said officials by a majority vote.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause\\n6\\nauthorizes the Senate to serve as a\\ncourt\\nwith the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict.\\n[\\n162\\n]\\nThree presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in\\n1868\\n, Bill Clinton in\\n1998\\n, and Donald Trump in\\n2019\\nand\\n2021\\n; none have been convicted by the Senate. Additionally, the\\nHouse Judiciary Committee\\nconducted an impeachment inquiry against Richard Nixon in\\n1973\\u201374\\nand reported  three articles of impeachment to the House of Representatives for final action; however, he resigned from office before the House voted on them.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nCircumvention of authority\\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the part of the president, or with a long-term disability. In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders. This has ranged from\\nRichard Nixon\\n's Chief of Staff not transmitting orders to the Cabinet due to the president's heavy drinking, to staff removing memos from\\nDonald Trump\\n's desk.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nDecades before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a\\nstroke that left him partly incapacitated\\n.

In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the\\nBoeing C-32\\n, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet.

Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House:\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwas elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for 17 years, and\\nAndrew Johnson\\nreturned to the Senate in 1875, though he died soon after.

During his presidency, George W. Bush called on former presidents George H. W. Bush and Clinton to assist with humanitarian efforts after the\\n2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami\\n. President Obama followed suit by asking presidents Clinton and George W. Bush to lead efforts to aid Haiti after an\\nearthquake\\ndevastated that country in 2010.  Clinton's relationship with the two Bushes is not the first friendship between former presidents: Carter enjoyed a friendship and correspondence with\\nGerald Ford\\n, while Jefferson and\\nJohn Adams\\nhad an extended correspondence through letters in their post-presidencies.\\nClinton has been active politically since his presidential term ended\\n, working with his wife\\nHillary\\non her\\n2008\\nand\\n2016\\npresidential bids and President Obama on his\\n2012 reelection campaign\\n.

The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff.  The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by\\nimpeachment\\n.\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nAccording to a 2008 report by the\\nCongressional Research Service\\n:\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nChief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nFormer presidents who served in Congress may also collect\\ncongressional pensions\\n.\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nThe act also provides former presidents with travel funds and\\nfranking\\nprivileges.\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.\\n[\\n189\\n]\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nIn 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nOn January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him,\\nGeorge W.

Some even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document:\\nThe\\nHarry S.

In some cases (such as with Nixon), the presidential library is adjacent to one of the president's former homes, where in other cases, such as with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, the presidential library and the historic site are in different cities entirely.\\nPolitical affiliation\\nPolitical parties\\nhave dominated\\nAmerican politics\\nfor most of the nation's history. Though the\\nFounding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from\\npolitical factions\\n, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the\\nWashington administration\\nwere referred to as \\\"pro-administration\\\" and would eventually form the\\nFederalist Party\\n, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\n.\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained\\nunaffiliated\\nwith any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.\\n[\\n196\\n]\\n[\\n197\\n]\\nSince Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office, and, since 1869, every president has been a member of either the\\nRepublican\\nor\\nDemocratic\\nParties.\\n[\\n198\\n]\\n[\\n199\\n]\\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\\nParty\\nNumber of\\npresidents\\nName(s)\\nRepublican\\n19\\nChester\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Arthur\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0H.\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nCalvin\\u00a0Coolidge\\n,\\nDwight\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Eisenhower\\n,\\nGerald\\u00a0Ford\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Garfield\\n,\\nUlysses\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Grant\\n,\\nWarren\\u00a0G.\\u00a0Harding\\n,\\nBenjamin\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nRutherford\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Hayes\\n,\\nHerbert\\u00a0Hoover\\n,\\nAbraham\\u00a0Lincoln\\n,\\n[\\nG\\n]\\nWilliam\\u00a0McKinley\\n,\\nRichard\\u00a0Nixon\\n,\\nRonald\\u00a0Reagan\\n,\\nTheodore\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Howard\\u00a0Taft\\n, and\\nDonald\\u00a0Trump\\n(incumbent)\\nDemocratic\\n15\\nJoe Biden\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Buchanan\\n,\\nJimmy\\u00a0Carter\\n,\\nGrover\\u00a0Cleveland\\n,\\nBill\\u00a0Clinton\\n,\\nAndrew\\u00a0Jackson\\n,\\nLyndon\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Johnson\\n,\\nJohn\\u00a0F.\\u00a0Kennedy\\n,\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0Pierce\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0K.\\u00a0Polk\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nHarry\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Truman\\n,\\nMartin\\u00a0Van\\u00a0Buren\\n, and\\nWoodrow\\u00a0Wilson\\nDemocratic-Republican\\n4\\nJohn\\u00a0Quincy\\u00a0Adams\\n,\\nThomas\\u00a0Jefferson\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Madison\\n, and\\nJames\\u00a0Monroe\\nWhig\\n4\\nMillard\\u00a0Fillmore\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Henry\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nZachary\\u00a0Taylor\\n, and\\nJohn\\u00a0Tyler\\n[\\nH\\n]\\nFederalist\\n1\\nJohn\\u00a0Adams\\nNational Union\\n1\\nAndrew\\u00a0Johnson\\n[\\nI\\n]\\nIndependent\\n(No party)\\n1\\nGeorge\\u00a0Washington\\nTimeline of presidents\\nSee also:\\nList of presidents of the United States\\nThe following\\ntimeline\\ndepicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.\\nSee also\\nUnited States portal\\nPolitics portal\\nOutline of American politics\\nNotes\\n^\\nIn addition to $100,000 in travel reimbursement, $19,000 for entertainment and $50,000 for additional expenses.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\n^\\nThe informal term POTUS originated in the\\nPhillips Code\\n, a shorthand method created in 1879 by\\nWalter P.

The new government did not commence until the old government expired. It is apparent that the government did not commence on the Constitution's being ratified by the ninth state, for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognized by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members. It existed potentially until March 2, the day preceding that on which the members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\\\"\\nOwings v.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

The president directs the\\nexecutive branch\\nof the\\nfederal government\\nand is the\\ncommander-in-chief\\nof the\\nUnited States Armed Forces\\n.\\nThe power of the presidency has grown\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nsince the first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\n, took office in 1789.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nWhile presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasing role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with some expansions during the presidencies of\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nand\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining\\nsuperpower\\n.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nAs the leader of the nation with the\\nlargest economy by nominal GDP\\n, the president possesses significant domestic and international\\nhard\\nand\\nsoft power\\n. For much of the 20th century, especially during the\\nCold War\\n, the U.S. president was often called \\\"the leader of the free world\\\".\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nArticle II of the Constitution\\nestablishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's\\nmost expensive military\\n, which has the\\nsecond-largest nuclear arsenal\\n.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of\\nseparation of powers\\n,\\nArticle I, Section\\n7\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or\\nveto\\nfederal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is\\nelected indirectly\\nthrough the\\nElectoral College\\nto a four-year term, along with the\\nvice president\\n. Under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a\\npresident's intra-term death\\nor\\nresignation\\n.\\n[\\nC\\n]\\nIn all,\\n45 individuals\\nhave served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.\\n[\\nD\\n]\\nDonald Trump\\nis the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\nIn July 1776, the\\nThirteen Colonies\\n, represented at the\\nSecond Continental Congress\\nin\\nPhiladelphia\\n, unanimously adopted the\\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\\nin which the colonies declared themselves to be independent\\nsovereign states\\nand no longer under\\nBritish\\nrule.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe affirmation was made in the\\nDeclaration of Independence\\n, which was written predominantly by\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the\\nBritish\\n,\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nthe Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates\\ntogether. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nCongress finished work on the\\nArticles of Confederation\\nto establish a\\nperpetual union\\nbetween the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for\\nratification\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nUnder the Articles, which\\ntook effect\\non March 1, 1781, the\\nCongress of the Confederation\\nwas a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThis institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of\\nCrown\\nand\\nParliament\\nought to have functioned with respect to the royal\\ndominion\\n: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly\\nroyal prerogatives\\n(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a\\npresident of the United States in Congress Assembled\\nto preside over its deliberation as a neutral\\ndiscussion moderator\\n. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1783, the\\nTreaty of Paris\\nsecured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nBy 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their\\nhard currency\\npouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their\\nMediterranean\\ncommerce preyed upon by\\nNorth African\\npirates\\n, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nCivil and political unrest loomed.  Events such as the\\nNewburgh Conspiracy\\nand\\nShays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between\\nVirginia\\nand Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference\\nin 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in\\nAnnapolis, Maryland\\n, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms.

Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nPresident\\nLyndon B. Johnson\\nsigns the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act\\nat the\\nWhite House\\non July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\nand others look on.\\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the\\nPresentment Clause\\n, which gives the president the power to veto any\\nbill\\npassed by\\nCongress\\n. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\nof both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.  The veto \\u2013 or threat of a veto \\u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\nSign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill\\nbecomes law\\n.\\nVeto\\nthe legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\n.\\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto\\n.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the\\nLine Item Veto Act\\n. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In\\nClinton v. City of New York\\n,\\n524\\nU.S.\\n417\\n(1998), the\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nSetting the agenda\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump\\ndelivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore\\nCongress\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \\\"necessary and expedient\\\". This is done through the constitutionally-based\\nState of the Union\\naddress, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nPresidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of\\nagencies\\nthat can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\\"virtual army of 'czars'\\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\\".\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nPresidents have been criticized for making\\nsigning statements\\nwhen signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nThis practice has been criticized by the\\nAmerican Bar Association\\nas unconstitutional.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nConservative commentator\\nGeorge Will\\nwrote of an \\\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\\" and \\\"the eclipse of Congress\\\".\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by\\nArticle II, Section\\n3\\nof the Constitution to call a\\nspecial session\\nof one or both houses of Congress. Since\\nJohn Adams\\nfirst did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions.\\nHarry S. Truman\\nwas the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the\\nTurnip Day Session\\n. In addition, prior to ratification of the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\nin 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly\\ninaugurated\\npresidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nExecutive powers\\nMain article:\\nPowers of the president of the United States\\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

However, these nominations require\\nSenate confirmation\\nbefore they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to\\nU.S. district courts\\n, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of\\nsenatorial courtesy\\n. Presidents may also grant\\npardons\\nand\\nreprieves\\n.\\nGerald Ford\\npardoned\\nRichard Nixon\\na month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when\\nBill Clinton\\npardoned\\nPatty Hearst\\non his last day in office; this is often\\ncontroversial\\n.\\n[\\n98\\n]\\n[\\n99\\n]\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is\\nexecutive privilege\\n, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see\\nChief Justice\\nJohn Jay\\n's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain\\n. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nUnited States v. Nixon\\n, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the\\nLewinsky scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nClinton v. Jones\\n, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the\\nlegal precedent\\nthat executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nThe\\nstate secrets privilege\\nallows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from\\ndiscovery\\nin legal proceedings if such release would harm\\nnational security\\n. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when\\nThomas Jefferson\\nrefused to release military documents in the\\ntreason\\ntrial of\\nAaron Burr\\nand again in\\nTotten v. United States\\n, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHowever, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until\\nUnited States v. Reynolds\\n, where it was held to be a\\ncommon law\\nevidentiary\\nprivilege.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nBefore the\\nSeptember 11 attacks\\n, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nSince 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the\\nNinth Circuit\\n's ruling in\\nMohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nCritics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has\\nabsolute immunity\\nfrom court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions.\\nNixon v. Fitzgerald\\n(1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions.\\nClinton v. Jones\\n(1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019\\nMueller report\\non Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible\\nobstruction of justice\\n, but investigators declined to refer\\nDonald Trump\\nfor prosecution based on a\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\npolicy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy.

Hayes\\nbegan in 1878 the first White House\\negg rolling\\nfor local children.\\n[\\n117\\n]\\nBeginning in 1947, during the\\nHarry S. Truman\\nadministration, every\\nThanksgiving\\nthe president is presented with a live domestic turkey during the annual\\nNational Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation\\nheld at the White House. Since 1989, when the custom of \\\"pardoning\\\" the turkey was formalized by\\nGeorge H. W. Bush\\n, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.\\n[\\n118\\n]\\nPresidential traditions also involve the president's role as head of government. Many outgoing presidents since\\nJames Buchanan\\ntraditionally give advice to their successor during the\\npresidential transition\\n.\\n[\\n119\\n]\\nRonald Reagan\\nand his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on\\nInauguration Day\\nfor the incoming president.\\n[\\n120\\n]\\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration\\npublic relations\\nofficials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\\"propagandized leadership\\\" which has a \\\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\\".\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nAdministration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops\\nof smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nOne critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \\\"in rich detail\\\" which \\\"drew on the power of myth\\\" regarding the incident of\\nPT 109\\n[\\n123\\n]\\nand wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.\\n[\\n124\\n]\\nAs a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \\\"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\\\".\\n[\\n125\\n]\\nHead of party\\nThe president is typically considered to be the\\nde facto\\nhead and spokesperson of their political party.  With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party's voters.  Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The\\ncoattail effect\\n, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.  Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\nGlobal leader\\nWith the rise of the United States as a\\nsuperpower\\nin the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of\\nNATO\\n, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the\\nEuropean Union\\n, have led to the moniker that the president is the \\\"\\nleader of the free world\\n\\\".\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5\\nof the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\nbe a\\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\\n;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a\\nresident in the United States\\nfor at least 14 years.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 7\\n, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nUnder\\nSection 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment\\n, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nThere is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding\\nConfederates\\nfrom public office after the Civil War.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nUnder the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nPrior experience\\nMain articles:\\nList of presidents of the United States by other offices held\\n,\\nList of presidents of the United States by previous experience\\n, and\\nList of presidents of the United States by education\\nThere are no requirements for previous or concurrent offices held by the President or presidential candidates.  However, every President except Donald Trump has been a\\ngovernor\\n,\\nU.S. senator\\nor\\nCongressman\\n,\\ngeneral\\nor\\ncabinet member\\n.\\nThe most common previous profession of presidents is lawyer, applying to 27 of the 45 men who have served as President.\\n[\\n133\\n]\\nHowever, several future Presidents abandoned the study or practice of law prior to the Presidency.  There has never been a property qualification for the Presidency or other federal offices, but, in the early years of the republic, there were\\nproperty qualifications for voting\\nor for some of the stepping-stone offices to the Presidency (particularly governorships).  Prior to the Civil War, it was common for presidents to be men of significant property: Presidents from the North tended to own small farms, while several Southern presidents owned plantations and\\nslaves\\n.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n[\\n135\\n]\\nWhile several later presidents came from abject poverty, others, such as the Roosevelts, John Kennedy, and Donald Trump, were parties to extensive family fortunes.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n33 of the 45 men who served as President, including every president since 1953 and all but one since 1901, have had a bachelor's degree.

Typically, the party's presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee, and this choice is\\nrubber-stamped\\nby the convention.\\nNominees participate in\\nnationally televised debates\\n, and while the debates are usually restricted to the\\nDemocratic\\nand\\nRepublican\\nnominees,\\nthird party\\ncandidates may be invited, such as\\nRoss Perot\\nin the 1992 debates.

As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the\\nTwenty-third Amendment\\nprovides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.\\n[\\n136\\n]\\nCurrently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nIn all but two states, the party whose presidential\\u2013vice presidential\\nticket\\nreceives a\\nplurality\\nof popular votes in the state has its entire\\nslate\\nof elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nMaine\\nand\\nNebraska\\ndeviate from this\\nwinner-take-all\\npractice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each\\ncongressional district\\n.\\n[\\n139\\n]\\n[\\n140\\n]\\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the\\nparty\\nthat nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are\\npledged\\n.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nThe constitutionality of these laws was upheld in\\nChiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nFollowing the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an\\nabsolute majority\\nof electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the\\nHouse of Representatives\\nmust meet to elect a president using a\\ncontingent election\\nprocedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top\\nthree\\nelectoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\\u201373 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand fellow Democratic-Republican\\nAaron Burr\\nin the\\nelection of 1800\\nnecessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n3\\nof the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the\\nrunner-up\\nwould become vice president.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nOn February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the\\nTwelfth Amendment\\nin time to be used in the\\n1804 election\\n.\\n[\\n145\\n]\\nA quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the\\nelection of 1824\\n. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients:\\nAndrew Jackson\\n,\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\n, and\\nWilliam H. Crawford\\n. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.\\n[\\n146\\n]\\nInauguration\\nMain article:\\nUnited States presidential inauguration\\nPursuant to the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\n, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election.\\n[\\n147\\n]\\nThe first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as\\nInauguration Day\\n, were the\\nsecond terms\\nof President\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nand Vice President\\nJohn Nance Garner\\nin 1937.\\n[\\n148\\n]\\nPreviously, Inauguration Day was on March 4. As a result of the date change, the first term (1933\\u201337) of both men had been shortened by 43 days.\\n[\\n149\\n]\\nBefore executing the powers of the office, a president is required to\\nrecite\\nthe\\npresidential Oath of Office\\n, found in\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n8 of the Constitution\\n. This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution:\\nI do solemnly swear (or\\naffirm\\n) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nPresidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a\\nBible\\nwhile taking the oath, and have added \\\"So help me God\\\" to the end of the oath.\\n[\\n151\\n]\\n[\\n152\\n]\\nAlthough the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the\\nchief justice of the United States\\n.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nIncumbency\\nTerm limit\\nPresident\\nWilliam McKinley\\nand his vice presidential running mate, New York Governor\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\n,\\nc.\\n1900\\nFranklin D.

Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in\\nWorld War II\\n, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nIn response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\nwas\\nadopted\\nin 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term.\\nHarry S. Truman\\n, the president at the time it was submitted to the states by the Congress, was exempted from its limitations. Without the exemption, he would not have been eligible to run for a second full term in 1952 (which he briefly sought), as he had served nearly all of Franklin Roosevelt's unexpired 1945\\u20131949 term and had been elected to a full four-year term beginning in 1949.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nVacancies and succession\\nUnder\\nSection\\n1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment\\n, ratified in 1967, the vice president becomes president upon the\\nremoval from office\\n, death, or resignation of the president. Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession),\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6\\n, stated only that the vice president assumes the \\\"powers and duties\\\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nUnder this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply\\nact\\nas president,\\n[\\n157\\n]\\npotentially resulting in a\\nspecial election\\n. Upon the death of President\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nin 1841, Vice President\\nJohn Tyler\\ndeclared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \\\"Acting President\\\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\\\".\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nThe\\nPresidential Succession Act\\nof 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C. \\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the\\npresidential line of succession\\nfollows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments\\nwho form the president's\\ncabinet\\n. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nDeclarations of inability\\nMain article:\\nTwenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes\\nacting president\\n, by transmitting to the\\nspeaker of the House\\nand the\\npresident\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate\\na statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by\\nRonald Reagan\\n(once),\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n(twice), and\\nJoe Biden\\n(once), each in anticipation of surgery.\\n[\\n159\\n]\\n[\\n160\\n]\\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment also provides that the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the\\nCabinet\\n, may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration, to the speaker of the House and the president\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate, to the effect that the president is unable to discharge his or her powers and duties. If the president then declares that no such inability exist, he or she resumes the presidential powers unless the vice president and Cabinet make a second declaration of presidential inability, in which case Congress decides the question.\\nRemoval\\nMain articles:\\nList of efforts to impeach presidents of the United States\\n,\\nFederal impeachment in the United States\\n, and\\nFederal impeachment trial in the United States\\nArticle II, Section 4\\nof the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \\\"\\ntreason\\n,\\nbribery\\n, or other\\nhigh crimes and misdemeanors\\n\\\".\\nArticle I, Section 2, Clause\\n5\\nauthorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a \\\"\\ngrand jury\\n\\\" with the power to impeach said officials by a majority vote.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause\\n6\\nauthorizes the Senate to serve as a\\ncourt\\nwith the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict.\\n[\\n162\\n]\\nThree presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in\\n1868\\n, Bill Clinton in\\n1998\\n, and Donald Trump in\\n2019\\nand\\n2021\\n; none have been convicted by the Senate. Additionally, the\\nHouse Judiciary Committee\\nconducted an impeachment inquiry against Richard Nixon in\\n1973\\u201374\\nand reported  three articles of impeachment to the House of Representatives for final action; however, he resigned from office before the House voted on them.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nCircumvention of authority\\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the part of the president, or with a long-term disability. In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders. This has ranged from\\nRichard Nixon\\n's Chief of Staff not transmitting orders to the Cabinet due to the president's heavy drinking, to staff removing memos from\\nDonald Trump\\n's desk.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nDecades before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a\\nstroke that left him partly incapacitated\\n.

Obama has also been active politically since his presidential term ended, having worked with his former vice president\\nJoe Biden\\non his\\n2020 election campaign\\nand Biden's vice president\\nKamala Harris\\non her\\n2024 election campaign\\nafter President Biden\\nwithdrew his bid for re-election\\n.\\nAfter losing his bid for the presidency in 2020, Trump remained politically active and was an outspoken critic of his successor and the Democratic Party. He also contended with four criminal cases. Trump announced his fourth bid to the presidency in 2022, ultimately becoming the nominee of his party for the third time and won a second presidential term in 2024.\\nGrover Cleveland\\nwas also elected to nonconsecutive terms; his reelection bid failed in\\n1888\\nbut succeeded in\\n1892\\n.\\nPension and other benefits\\nThe\\nFormer Presidents Act\\n(FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection; also provided is funding for a certain number of staff and for office expenses.  The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff.  The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by\\nimpeachment\\n.\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nAccording to a 2008 report by the\\nCongressional Research Service\\n:\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nChief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nFormer presidents who served in Congress may also collect\\ncongressional pensions\\n.\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nThe act also provides former presidents with travel funds and\\nfranking\\nprivileges.\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.\\n[\\n189\\n]\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nIn 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nOn January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him,\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n, and all subsequent presidents.\\n[\\n192\\n]\\nA\\nfirst spouse\\nwho remarries is no longer eligible for Secret Service protection.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nWriting\\nMain article:\\nList of autobiographies by presidents of the United States\\nSince the publication of\\nUlysses S. Grant\\n's\\nPersonal Memoirs\\nin 1885, most presidents, including every president who survived to the end of their term from Calvin Coolidge to Barack Obama, has written at least one autobiography.  These autobiographies serve two purposes: to ensure the First Family's financial security (Clinton made over $30 million dollars from writing two books\\n[\\n193\\n]\\n), but also to defend or rehabilitate presidential legacies.\\nPresidential libraries and historic sites\\nMain articles:\\nPresidential library system\\nand\\nList of residences of presidents of the United States\\nThe homes where U.S. presidents were born, lived or vacationed have frequently been preserved as\\nhouse museums\\nand listed as\\nNational Historic Sites\\nor on\\nU.S. National Register of Historic Places\\n.\\nFrom left to right: Presidents\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nGeorge W.

Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nDallas\\nin 2013\\nEvery president since\\nHerbert Hoover\\nhas created a\\nrepository\\nknown as a\\npresidential library\\nfor preserving and making available his papers, records, and other documents and materials. Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the\\nNational Archives and Records Administration\\n(NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.\\n[\\n194\\n]\\nThere are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, including:\\nThe\\nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the State of\\nIllinois\\n;\\nThe\\nGeorge W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by\\nSouthern Methodist University\\n;\\nThe\\nGeorge H. W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by\\nTexas A&M University\\n; and\\nThe\\nLyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the\\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\\n.\\nSeveral former presidents have overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document:\\nThe\\nHarry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nIndependence, Missouri\\n;\\nThe\\nDwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home\\nin\\nAbilene, Kansas\\n;\\nThe\\nRichard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nYorba Linda, California\\n; and\\nThe\\nRonald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nSimi Valley, California\\n.\\nThese gravesites are open to the general public.  In some cases (such as with Nixon), the presidential library is adjacent to one of the president's former homes, where in other cases, such as with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, the presidential library and the historic site are in different cities entirely.\\nPolitical affiliation\\nPolitical parties\\nhave dominated\\nAmerican politics\\nfor most of the nation's history. Though the\\nFounding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from\\npolitical factions\\n, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the\\nWashington administration\\nwere referred to as \\\"pro-administration\\\" and would eventually form the\\nFederalist Party\\n, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\n.\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained\\nunaffiliated\\nwith any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.\\n[\\n196\\n]\\n[\\n197\\n]\\nSince Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office, and, since 1869, every president has been a member of either the\\nRepublican\\nor\\nDemocratic\\nParties.\\n[\\n198\\n]\\n[\\n199\\n]\\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\\nParty\\nNumber of\\npresidents\\nName(s)\\nRepublican\\n19\\nChester\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Arthur\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0H.\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nCalvin\\u00a0Coolidge\\n,\\nDwight\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Eisenhower\\n,\\nGerald\\u00a0Ford\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Garfield\\n,\\nUlysses\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Grant\\n,\\nWarren\\u00a0G.\\u00a0Harding\\n,\\nBenjamin\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nRutherford\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Hayes\\n,\\nHerbert\\u00a0Hoover\\n,\\nAbraham\\u00a0Lincoln\\n,\\n[\\nG\\n]\\nWilliam\\u00a0McKinley\\n,\\nRichard\\u00a0Nixon\\n,\\nRonald\\u00a0Reagan\\n,\\nTheodore\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Howard\\u00a0Taft\\n, and\\nDonald\\u00a0Trump\\n(incumbent)\\nDemocratic\\n15\\nJoe Biden\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Buchanan\\n,\\nJimmy\\u00a0Carter\\n,\\nGrover\\u00a0Cleveland\\n,\\nBill\\u00a0Clinton\\n,\\nAndrew\\u00a0Jackson\\n,\\nLyndon\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Johnson\\n,\\nJohn\\u00a0F.\\u00a0Kennedy\\n,\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0Pierce\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0K.\\u00a0Polk\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nHarry\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Truman\\n,\\nMartin\\u00a0Van\\u00a0Buren\\n, and\\nWoodrow\\u00a0Wilson\\nDemocratic-Republican\\n4\\nJohn\\u00a0Quincy\\u00a0Adams\\n,\\nThomas\\u00a0Jefferson\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Madison\\n, and\\nJames\\u00a0Monroe\\nWhig\\n4\\nMillard\\u00a0Fillmore\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Henry\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nZachary\\u00a0Taylor\\n, and\\nJohn\\u00a0Tyler\\n[\\nH\\n]\\nFederalist\\n1\\nJohn\\u00a0Adams\\nNational Union\\n1\\nAndrew\\u00a0Johnson\\n[\\nI\\n]\\nIndependent\\n(No party)\\n1\\nGeorge\\u00a0Washington\\nTimeline of presidents\\nSee also:\\nList of presidents of the United States\\nThe following\\ntimeline\\ndepicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.\\nSee also\\nUnited States portal\\nPolitics portal\\nOutline of American politics\\nNotes\\n^\\nIn addition to $100,000 in travel reimbursement, $19,000 for entertainment and $50,000 for additional expenses.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\n^\\nThe informal term POTUS originated in the\\nPhillips Code\\n, a shorthand method created in 1879 by\\nWalter P.

Later, while president, Johnson tried and failed to build a party of loyalists under the National Union banner.

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 contains only vague consultation requirements. Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act. Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and unconstitutional, and no president in the past 35 years has filed a report \\\"pursuant\\\" to these triggering provisions.\\n^\\na\\nb\\nc\\nd\\n\\\"The Law: The President's War Powers\\\"\\n.\\nTime\\n.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

The new government did not commence until the old government expired.

In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members.

Roosevelt\\nand\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining\\nsuperpower\\n.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nAs the leader of the nation with the\\nlargest economy by nominal GDP\\n, the president possesses significant domestic and international\\nhard\\nand\\nsoft power\\n. For much of the 20th century, especially during the\\nCold War\\n, the U.S. president was often called \\\"the leader of the free world\\\".\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nArticle II of the Constitution\\nestablishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's\\nmost expensive military\\n, which has the\\nsecond-largest nuclear arsenal\\n.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of\\nseparation of powers\\n,\\nArticle I, Section\\n7\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or\\nveto\\nfederal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is\\nelected indirectly\\nthrough the\\nElectoral College\\nto a four-year term, along with the\\nvice president\\n. Under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a\\npresident's intra-term death\\nor\\nresignation\\n.\\n[\\nC\\n]\\nIn all,\\n45 individuals\\nhave served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.\\n[\\nD\\n]\\nDonald Trump\\nis the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\nIn July 1776, the\\nThirteen Colonies\\n, represented at the\\nSecond Continental Congress\\nin\\nPhiladelphia\\n, unanimously adopted the\\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\\nin which the colonies declared themselves to be independent\\nsovereign states\\nand no longer under\\nBritish\\nrule.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe affirmation was made in the\\nDeclaration of Independence\\n, which was written predominantly by\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the\\nBritish\\n,\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nthe Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates\\ntogether. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nCongress finished work on the\\nArticles of Confederation\\nto establish a\\nperpetual union\\nbetween the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for\\nratification\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nUnder the Articles, which\\ntook effect\\non March 1, 1781, the\\nCongress of the Confederation\\nwas a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThis institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of\\nCrown\\nand\\nParliament\\nought to have functioned with respect to the royal\\ndominion\\n: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly\\nroyal prerogatives\\n(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a\\npresident of the United States in Congress Assembled\\nto preside over its deliberation as a neutral\\ndiscussion moderator\\n. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1783, the\\nTreaty of Paris\\nsecured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nBy 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their\\nhard currency\\npouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their\\nMediterranean\\ncommerce preyed upon by\\nNorth African\\npirates\\n, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nCivil and political unrest loomed.  Events such as the\\nNewburgh Conspiracy\\nand\\nShays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between\\nVirginia\\nand Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference\\nin 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in\\nAnnapolis, Maryland\\n, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the\\nconvention\\nfailed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states,\\nAlexander Hamilton\\nof New York led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in\\nPhiladelphia\\n. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nEdmund Randolph\\nsucceeded in securing\\nGeorge Washington\\n's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nWhen the\\nConstitutional Convention\\nconvened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (\\nRhode Island\\ndid not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nNew York\\noffered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIt was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the\\nU.S. Constitution\\nemerged.\\n1789\\u20131933\\nGeorge Washington\\n, the first president of the United States\\nAs the nation's first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\nestablished many norms that would come to define the office.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nHis decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the\\nTwenty-Second Amendment\\n. By the end of his presidency, political parties had developed,\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nwith\\nJohn Adams\\ndefeating\\nThomas Jefferson\\nin 1796, the first truly contested presidential election.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nAfter Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow Virginians\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nJames Monroe\\nwould each serve two terms, eventually dominating the nation's politics during the\\nEra of Good Feelings\\nuntil Adams' son\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwon election in 1824 after the\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\nsplit.\\nThe election of\\nAndrew Jackson\\nin 1828 was a significant milestone, as Jackson was not part of the Virginia and Massachusetts elite that had held the presidency for its first 40 years.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nJacksonian democracy\\nsought to strengthen the presidency at the expense of Congress, while broadening public participation as the nation rapidly expanded westward. However, his successor,\\nMartin Van Buren\\n, became unpopular after the\\nPanic of 1837\\n,\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nand the death of\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nand subsequent poor relations between\\nJohn Tyler\\nand Congress led to further weakening of the office.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nIncluding Van Buren, in the 24 years between 1837 and 1861, six presidential terms would be filled by eight different men, with none serving two terms.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nThe Senate played an important role during this period, with the\\nGreat Triumvirate\\nof\\nHenry Clay\\n,\\nDaniel Webster\\n, and\\nJohn C.

Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nPresident\\nLyndon B. Johnson\\nsigns the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act\\nat the\\nWhite House\\non July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\nand others look on.\\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the\\nPresentment Clause\\n, which gives the president the power to veto any\\nbill\\npassed by\\nCongress\\n. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\nof both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.  The veto \\u2013 or threat of a veto \\u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\nSign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill\\nbecomes law\\n.\\nVeto\\nthe legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\n.\\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto\\n.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the\\nLine Item Veto Act\\n. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In\\nClinton v. City of New York\\n,\\n524\\nU.S.\\n417\\n(1998), the\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nSetting the agenda\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump\\ndelivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore\\nCongress\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \\\"necessary and expedient\\\". This is done through the constitutionally-based\\nState of the Union\\naddress, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nPresidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of\\nagencies\\nthat can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\\"virtual army of 'czars'\\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\\".\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nPresidents have been criticized for making\\nsigning statements\\nwhen signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nThis practice has been criticized by the\\nAmerican Bar Association\\nas unconstitutional.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nConservative commentator\\nGeorge Will\\nwrote of an \\\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\\" and \\\"the eclipse of Congress\\\".\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by\\nArticle II, Section\\n3\\nof the Constitution to call a\\nspecial session\\nof one or both houses of Congress. Since\\nJohn Adams\\nfirst did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions.\\nHarry S. Truman\\nwas the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the\\nTurnip Day Session\\n. In addition, prior to ratification of the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\nin 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly\\ninaugurated\\npresidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nExecutive powers\\nMain article:\\nPowers of the president of the United States\\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

Generally, a president may remove executive officials at will.\\n[\\n80\\n]\\nHowever, Congress can curtail and constrain a president's authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by\\nstatute\\n.\\n[\\n81\\n]\\nTo manage the growing federal bureaucracy, presidents have gradually surrounded themselves with many layers of staff, who were eventually organized into the\\nExecutive Office of the President of the United States\\n. Within the Executive Office, the president's innermost layer of aides, and their assistants, are located in the\\nWhite House Office\\n.\\nThe president also possesses the power to manage operations of the federal government by issuing various\\ntypes of directives\\n, such as\\npresidential proclamation\\nand\\nexecutive orders\\n. When the president is lawfully exercising one of the constitutionally conferred presidential responsibilities, the scope of this power is broad.\\n[\\n82\\n]\\nEven so, these directives are subject to\\njudicial review\\nby U.S. federal courts, which can find them to be unconstitutional.

Such agreements, upon receiving the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate (by a\\ntwo-thirds majority\\nvote), become binding with the force of federal law.\\nWhile foreign affairs has always been a significant element of presidential responsibilities, advances in technology since the Constitution's adoption have increased presidential power.

However, these nominations require\\nSenate confirmation\\nbefore they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to\\nU.S. district courts\\n, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of\\nsenatorial courtesy\\n. Presidents may also grant\\npardons\\nand\\nreprieves\\n.\\nGerald Ford\\npardoned\\nRichard Nixon\\na month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when\\nBill Clinton\\npardoned\\nPatty Hearst\\non his last day in office; this is often\\ncontroversial\\n.\\n[\\n98\\n]\\n[\\n99\\n]\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is\\nexecutive privilege\\n, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see\\nChief Justice\\nJohn Jay\\n's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain\\n. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nUnited States v. Nixon\\n, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the\\nLewinsky scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nClinton v. Jones\\n, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the\\nlegal precedent\\nthat executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nThe\\nstate secrets privilege\\nallows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from\\ndiscovery\\nin legal proceedings if such release would harm\\nnational security\\n. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when\\nThomas Jefferson\\nrefused to release military documents in the\\ntreason\\ntrial of\\nAaron Burr\\nand again in\\nTotten v. United States\\n, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHowever, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until\\nUnited States v. Reynolds\\n, where it was held to be a\\ncommon law\\nevidentiary\\nprivilege.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nBefore the\\nSeptember 11 attacks\\n, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nSince 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the\\nNinth Circuit\\n's ruling in\\nMohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nCritics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has\\nabsolute immunity\\nfrom court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions.\\nNixon v. Fitzgerald\\n(1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions.\\nClinton v. Jones\\n(1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019\\nMueller report\\non Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible\\nobstruction of justice\\n, but investigators declined to refer\\nDonald Trump\\nfor prosecution based on a\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\npolicy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy. As of October 2019, a case was pending in the federal courts regarding access to personal tax returns in a criminal case brought against Donald Trump by the\\nNew York County District Attorney\\nalleging violations of New York state law.\\n[\\n109\\n]\\nMemoranda from the\\nOffice of Legal Counsel\\nissued in 1973 and 2000 internally prohibit the Department of Justice from prosecuting a president, which some legal scholars have criticized but others have endorsed.\\n[\\n110\\n]\\nIn defense against federal criminal prosecution for his\\nalleged 2020 election subversion\\n, in January 2024, Trump argued to the\\nDC Circuit Court of Appeals\\nthat a president enjoys absolute immunity for criminal acts conducted while in office. The next month, a three-judge panel of the court unanimously ruled against Trump. It was the first time an appeals court had addressed such a presidential immunity matter, since no other sitting or former president had ever been criminally indicted.\\n[\\n111\\n]\\nIn\\nTrump v. United States\\n, on July 1, 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents were entitled to absolute immunity from exercising core powers enumerated by the Constitution,\\npresumption\\nof immunity for other official acts, and no immunity for unofficial actions. The case was sent back to lower courts to determine which actions in the criminal complaint should be classified as official vs. unofficial.\\n[\\n112\\n]\\nThe ruling was the first time the courts granted a president criminal immunity.\\nLeadership roles\\nHead of state\\nFour ruffles and flourishes and 'Hail to the Chief' (long version)\\nProblems playing this file? See\\nmedia help\\n.\\nAs\\nhead of state\\n, the president represents the United States government to its own people and represents the nation to the rest of the world. For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a\\nState Arrival Ceremony\\nheld on the\\nSouth Lawn\\n, a custom begun by\\nJohn F. Kennedy\\nin 1961.\\n[\\n113\\n]\\nThis is followed by a\\nstate dinner\\ngiven by the president which is held in the\\nState Dining Room\\nlater in the evening.\\n[\\n114\\n]\\nPresident\\nWoodrow Wilson\\nthrows out the ceremonial first ball on\\nOpening Day\\nin 1916\\nPresident\\nBill Clinton\\nreviews honor guards at\\nBuckingham Palace\\nduring a 1995 state visit to the UK\\nAs a national leader, the president also fulfills many less formal ceremonial duties. For example,\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\nstarted the tradition of throwing out the\\nceremonial first pitch\\nin 1910 at\\nGriffith Stadium\\n, Washington, D.C., on the\\nWashington Senators's\\nOpening Day\\n.

Since 1989, when the custom of \\\"pardoning\\\" the turkey was formalized by\\nGeorge H. W. Bush\\n, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.\\n[\\n118\\n]\\nPresidential traditions also involve the president's role as head of government. Many outgoing presidents since\\nJames Buchanan\\ntraditionally give advice to their successor during the\\npresidential transition\\n.\\n[\\n119\\n]\\nRonald Reagan\\nand his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on\\nInauguration Day\\nfor the incoming president.\\n[\\n120\\n]\\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration\\npublic relations\\nofficials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\\"propagandized leadership\\\" which has a \\\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\\".\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nAdministration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops\\nof smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nOne critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \\\"in rich detail\\\" which \\\"drew on the power of myth\\\" regarding the incident of\\nPT 109\\n[\\n123\\n]\\nand wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.\\n[\\n124\\n]\\nAs a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \\\"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\\\".\\n[\\n125\\n]\\nHead of party\\nThe president is typically considered to be the\\nde facto\\nhead and spokesperson of their political party.  With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party's voters.  Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The\\ncoattail effect\\n, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.  Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\nGlobal leader\\nWith the rise of the United States as a\\nsuperpower\\nin the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of\\nNATO\\n, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the\\nEuropean Union\\n, have led to the moniker that the president is the \\\"\\nleader of the free world\\n\\\".\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5\\nof the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\nbe a\\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\\n;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a\\nresident in the United States\\nfor at least 14 years.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 7\\n, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nUnder\\nSection 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment\\n, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nThere is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding\\nConfederates\\nfrom public office after the Civil War.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nUnder the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nPrior experience\\nMain articles:\\nList of presidents of the United States by other offices held\\n,\\nList of presidents of the United States by previous experience\\n, and\\nList of presidents of the United States by education\\nThere are no requirements for previous or concurrent offices held by the President or presidential candidates.

There has never been a property qualification for the Presidency or other federal offices, but, in the early years of the republic, there were\\nproperty qualifications for voting\\nor for some of the stepping-stone offices to the Presidency (particularly governorships).  Prior to the Civil War, it was common for presidents to be men of significant property: Presidents from the North tended to own small farms, while several Southern presidents owned plantations and\\nslaves\\n.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n[\\n135\\n]\\nWhile several later presidents came from abject poverty, others, such as the Roosevelts, John Kennedy, and Donald Trump, were parties to extensive family fortunes.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n33 of the 45 men who served as President, including every president since 1953 and all but one since 1901, have had a bachelor's degree.

As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the\\nTwenty-third Amendment\\nprovides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.\\n[\\n136\\n]\\nCurrently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nIn all but two states, the party whose presidential\\u2013vice presidential\\nticket\\nreceives a\\nplurality\\nof popular votes in the state has its entire\\nslate\\nof elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nMaine\\nand\\nNebraska\\ndeviate from this\\nwinner-take-all\\npractice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each\\ncongressional district\\n.\\n[\\n139\\n]\\n[\\n140\\n]\\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the\\nparty\\nthat nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are\\npledged\\n.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nThe constitutionality of these laws was upheld in\\nChiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nFollowing the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an\\nabsolute majority\\nof electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the\\nHouse of Representatives\\nmust meet to elect a president using a\\ncontingent election\\nprocedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top\\nthree\\nelectoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\\u201373 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand fellow Democratic-Republican\\nAaron Burr\\nin the\\nelection of 1800\\nnecessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n3\\nof the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the\\nrunner-up\\nwould become vice president.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nOn February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the\\nTwelfth Amendment\\nin time to be used in the\\n1804 election\\n.\\n[\\n145\\n]\\nA quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the\\nelection of 1824\\n. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients:\\nAndrew Jackson\\n,\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\n, and\\nWilliam H. Crawford\\n. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.\\n[\\n146\\n]\\nInauguration\\nMain article:\\nUnited States presidential inauguration\\nPursuant to the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\n, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election.\\n[\\n147\\n]\\nThe first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as\\nInauguration Day\\n, were the\\nsecond terms\\nof President\\nFranklin D.

Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession),\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6\\n, stated only that the vice president assumes the \\\"powers and duties\\\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nUnder this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply\\nact\\nas president,\\n[\\n157\\n]\\npotentially resulting in a\\nspecial election\\n. Upon the death of President\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nin 1841, Vice President\\nJohn Tyler\\ndeclared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \\\"Acting President\\\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\\\".\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nThe\\nPresidential Succession Act\\nof 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C. \\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the\\npresidential line of succession\\nfollows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments\\nwho form the president's\\ncabinet\\n. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nDeclarations of inability\\nMain article:\\nTwenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes\\nacting president\\n, by transmitting to the\\nspeaker of the House\\nand the\\npresident\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate\\na statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by\\nRonald Reagan\\n(once),\\nGeorge W.

In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders.

In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the\\nBoeing C-32\\n, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet.

Prominent examples include\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\n's tenure as\\nchief justice of the United States\\nand\\nHerbert Hoover\\n's work on government reorganization after\\nWorld War II\\n. Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House:\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwas elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for 17 years, and\\nAndrew Johnson\\nreturned to the Senate in 1875, though he died soon after.

Bill Clinton also worked as an informal ambassador, most recently in the negotiations that led to the release of two American\\njournalists\\n,\\nLaura Ling\\nand\\nEuna Lee\\n, from\\nNorth Korea\\n. During his presidency, George W. Bush called on former presidents George H. W. Bush and Clinton to assist with humanitarian efforts after the\\n2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami\\n. President Obama followed suit by asking presidents Clinton and George W. Bush to lead efforts to aid Haiti after an\\nearthquake\\ndevastated that country in 2010.  Clinton's relationship with the two Bushes is not the first friendship between former presidents: Carter enjoyed a friendship and correspondence with\\nGerald Ford\\n, while Jefferson and\\nJohn Adams\\nhad an extended correspondence through letters in their post-presidencies.\\nClinton has been active politically since his presidential term ended\\n, working with his wife\\nHillary\\non her\\n2008\\nand\\n2016\\npresidential bids and President Obama on his\\n2012 reelection campaign\\n.

He also contended with four criminal cases. Trump announced his fourth bid to the presidency in 2022, ultimately becoming the nominee of his party for the third time and won a second presidential term in 2024.\\nGrover Cleveland\\nwas also elected to nonconsecutive terms; his reelection bid failed in\\n1888\\nbut succeeded in\\n1892\\n.\\nPension and other benefits\\nThe\\nFormer Presidents Act\\n(FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection; also provided is funding for a certain number of staff and for office expenses.  The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff.  The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by\\nimpeachment\\n.\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nAccording to a 2008 report by the\\nCongressional Research Service\\n:\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nChief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nFormer presidents who served in Congress may also collect\\ncongressional pensions\\n.\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nThe act also provides former presidents with travel funds and\\nfranking\\nprivileges.\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.\\n[\\n189\\n]\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nIn 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nOn January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him,\\nGeorge W.

Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the\\nNational Archives and Records Administration\\n(NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.\\n[\\n194\\n]\\nThere are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, including:\\nThe\\nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the State of\\nIllinois\\n;\\nThe\\nGeorge W.

Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by\\nTexas A&M University\\n; and\\nThe\\nLyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the\\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\\n.\\nSeveral former presidents have overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document:\\nThe\\nHarry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nIndependence, Missouri\\n;\\nThe\\nDwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home\\nin\\nAbilene, Kansas\\n;\\nThe\\nRichard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nYorba Linda, California\\n; and\\nThe\\nRonald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nSimi Valley, California\\n.\\nThese gravesites are open to the general public.  In some cases (such as with Nixon), the presidential library is adjacent to one of the president's former homes, where in other cases, such as with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, the presidential library and the historic site are in different cities entirely.\\nPolitical affiliation\\nPolitical parties\\nhave dominated\\nAmerican politics\\nfor most of the nation's history. Though the\\nFounding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from\\npolitical factions\\n, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the\\nWashington administration\\nwere referred to as \\\"pro-administration\\\" and would eventually form the\\nFederalist Party\\n, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\n.\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained\\nunaffiliated\\nwith any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.\\n[\\n196\\n]\\n[\\n197\\n]\\nSince Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office, and, since 1869, every president has been a member of either the\\nRepublican\\nor\\nDemocratic\\nParties.\\n[\\n198\\n]\\n[\\n199\\n]\\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\\nParty\\nNumber of\\npresidents\\nName(s)\\nRepublican\\n19\\nChester\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Arthur\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0H.\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nCalvin\\u00a0Coolidge\\n,\\nDwight\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Eisenhower\\n,\\nGerald\\u00a0Ford\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Garfield\\n,\\nUlysses\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Grant\\n,\\nWarren\\u00a0G.\\u00a0Harding\\n,\\nBenjamin\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nRutherford\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Hayes\\n,\\nHerbert\\u00a0Hoover\\n,\\nAbraham\\u00a0Lincoln\\n,\\n[\\nG\\n]\\nWilliam\\u00a0McKinley\\n,\\nRichard\\u00a0Nixon\\n,\\nRonald\\u00a0Reagan\\n,\\nTheodore\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Howard\\u00a0Taft\\n, and\\nDonald\\u00a0Trump\\n(incumbent)\\nDemocratic\\n15\\nJoe Biden\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Buchanan\\n,\\nJimmy\\u00a0Carter\\n,\\nGrover\\u00a0Cleveland\\n,\\nBill\\u00a0Clinton\\n,\\nAndrew\\u00a0Jackson\\n,\\nLyndon\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Johnson\\n,\\nJohn\\u00a0F.\\u00a0Kennedy\\n,\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0Pierce\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0K.\\u00a0Polk\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nHarry\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Truman\\n,\\nMartin\\u00a0Van\\u00a0Buren\\n, and\\nWoodrow\\u00a0Wilson\\nDemocratic-Republican\\n4\\nJohn\\u00a0Quincy\\u00a0Adams\\n,\\nThomas\\u00a0Jefferson\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Madison\\n, and\\nJames\\u00a0Monroe\\nWhig\\n4\\nMillard\\u00a0Fillmore\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Henry\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nZachary\\u00a0Taylor\\n, and\\nJohn\\u00a0Tyler\\n[\\nH\\n]\\nFederalist\\n1\\nJohn\\u00a0Adams\\nNational Union\\n1\\nAndrew\\u00a0Johnson\\n[\\nI\\n]\\nIndependent\\n(No party)\\n1\\nGeorge\\u00a0Washington\\nTimeline of presidents\\nSee also:\\nList of presidents of the United States\\nThe following\\ntimeline\\ndepicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.\\nSee also\\nUnited States portal\\nPolitics portal\\nOutline of American politics\\nNotes\\n^\\nIn addition to $100,000 in travel reimbursement, $19,000 for entertainment and $50,000 for additional expenses.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\n^\\nThe informal term POTUS originated in the\\nPhillips Code\\n, a shorthand method created in 1879 by\\nWalter P.

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 contains only vague consultation requirements. Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act. Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and unconstitutional, and no president in the past 35 years has filed a report \\\"pursuant\\\" to these triggering provisions.\\n^\\na\\nb\\nc\\nd\\n\\\"The Law: The President's War Powers\\\"\\n.\\nTime\\n.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

The new government did not commence until the old government expired. It is apparent that the government did not commence on the Constitution's being ratified by the ninth state, for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognized by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members. It existed potentially until March 2, the day preceding that on which the members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\\\"\\nOwings v.

The president directs the\\nexecutive branch\\nof the\\nfederal government\\nand is the\\ncommander-in-chief\\nof the\\nUnited States Armed Forces\\n.\\nThe power of the presidency has grown\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nsince the first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\n, took office in 1789.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nWhile presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasing role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with some expansions during the presidencies of\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nand\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining\\nsuperpower\\n.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nAs the leader of the nation with the\\nlargest economy by nominal GDP\\n, the president possesses significant domestic and international\\nhard\\nand\\nsoft power\\n. For much of the 20th century, especially during the\\nCold War\\n, the U.S. president was often called \\\"the leader of the free world\\\".\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nArticle II of the Constitution\\nestablishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's\\nmost expensive military\\n, which has the\\nsecond-largest nuclear arsenal\\n.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of\\nseparation of powers\\n,\\nArticle I, Section\\n7\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or\\nveto\\nfederal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is\\nelected indirectly\\nthrough the\\nElectoral College\\nto a four-year term, along with the\\nvice president\\n. Under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a\\npresident's intra-term death\\nor\\nresignation\\n.\\n[\\nC\\n]\\nIn all,\\n45 individuals\\nhave served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.\\n[\\nD\\n]\\nDonald Trump\\nis the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\nIn July 1776, the\\nThirteen Colonies\\n, represented at the\\nSecond Continental Congress\\nin\\nPhiladelphia\\n, unanimously adopted the\\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\\nin which the colonies declared themselves to be independent\\nsovereign states\\nand no longer under\\nBritish\\nrule.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe affirmation was made in the\\nDeclaration of Independence\\n, which was written predominantly by\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the\\nBritish\\n,\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nthe Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates\\ntogether. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nCongress finished work on the\\nArticles of Confederation\\nto establish a\\nperpetual union\\nbetween the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for\\nratification\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nUnder the Articles, which\\ntook effect\\non March 1, 1781, the\\nCongress of the Confederation\\nwas a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThis institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of\\nCrown\\nand\\nParliament\\nought to have functioned with respect to the royal\\ndominion\\n: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly\\nroyal prerogatives\\n(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a\\npresident of the United States in Congress Assembled\\nto preside over its deliberation as a neutral\\ndiscussion moderator\\n. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1783, the\\nTreaty of Paris\\nsecured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nBy 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their\\nhard currency\\npouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their\\nMediterranean\\ncommerce preyed upon by\\nNorth African\\npirates\\n, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nCivil and political unrest loomed.  Events such as the\\nNewburgh Conspiracy\\nand\\nShays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between\\nVirginia\\nand Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference\\nin 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in\\nAnnapolis, Maryland\\n, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the\\nconvention\\nfailed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states,\\nAlexander Hamilton\\nof New York led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in\\nPhiladelphia\\n. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nEdmund Randolph\\nsucceeded in securing\\nGeorge Washington\\n's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nWhen the\\nConstitutional Convention\\nconvened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (\\nRhode Island\\ndid not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nNew York\\noffered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIt was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the\\nU.S. Constitution\\nemerged.\\n1789\\u20131933\\nGeorge Washington\\n, the first president of the United States\\nAs the nation's first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\nestablished many norms that would come to define the office.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nHis decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the\\nTwenty-Second Amendment\\n. By the end of his presidency, political parties had developed,\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nwith\\nJohn Adams\\ndefeating\\nThomas Jefferson\\nin 1796, the first truly contested presidential election.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nAfter Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow Virginians\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nJames Monroe\\nwould each serve two terms, eventually dominating the nation's politics during the\\nEra of Good Feelings\\nuntil Adams' son\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwon election in 1824 after the\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\nsplit.\\nThe election of\\nAndrew Jackson\\nin 1828 was a significant milestone, as Jackson was not part of the Virginia and Massachusetts elite that had held the presidency for its first 40 years.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nJacksonian democracy\\nsought to strengthen the presidency at the expense of Congress, while broadening public participation as the nation rapidly expanded westward. However, his successor,\\nMartin Van Buren\\n, became unpopular after the\\nPanic of 1837\\n,\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nand the death of\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nand subsequent poor relations between\\nJohn Tyler\\nand Congress led to further weakening of the office.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nIncluding Van Buren, in the 24 years between 1837 and 1861, six presidential terms would be filled by eight different men, with none serving two terms.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nThe Senate played an important role during this period, with the\\nGreat Triumvirate\\nof\\nHenry Clay\\n,\\nDaniel Webster\\n, and\\nJohn C. Calhoun\\nplaying key roles in shaping national policy in the 1830s and 1840s until debates over slavery began pulling the nation apart in the 1850s.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nAbraham Lincoln\\n's leadership during the\\nCivil War\\nhas led historians to regard him as one of the nation's greatest presidents.\\n[\\nE\\n]\\nThe circumstances of the war and Republican domination of Congress made the office very powerful,\\n[\\n37\\n]\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nand Lincoln's re-election in 1864 was the first time a president had been re-elected since Jackson in 1832. After Lincoln's assassination, his successor\\nAndrew Johnson\\nlost all political support\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nand was nearly removed from office,\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nwith Congress remaining powerful during the two-term presidency of Civil War general\\nUlysses S. Grant\\n. After the end of\\nReconstruction\\n,\\nGrover Cleveland\\nwould eventually become the first Democratic president elected since before the war, running in three consecutive elections (1884, 1888, 1892) and winning twice. In 1900,\\nWilliam McKinley\\nbecame the first incumbent to win re-election since Grant in 1872.\\nAfter McKinley's\\nassassination\\nby\\nLeon Czolgosz\\nin 1901,\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\nbecame a dominant figure in American politics.\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nHistorians believe Roosevelt permanently changed the political system by strengthening the presidency,\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nwith some key accomplishments including breaking up trusts, conservationism, labor reforms, making personal character as important as the issues, and hand-picking his successor,\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\n. The following decade,\\nWoodrow Wilson\\nled the nation to victory during\\nWorld War I\\n, although Wilson's proposal for the\\nLeague of Nations\\nwas rejected by the Senate.\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nWarren Harding\\n, while popular in office, would see his legacy tarnished by scandals, especially\\nTeapot Dome\\n,\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nand\\nHerbert Hoover\\nquickly became very unpopular after failing to alleviate the\\nGreat Depression\\n.\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nImperial presidency\\nMain article:\\nImperial presidency\\nPresident\\nFranklin D.

Roosevelt\\nin 1933 led further toward what historians now describe as the\\nImperial presidency\\n.\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nBacked by enormous Democratic majorities in Congress and public support for major change, Roosevelt's\\nNew Deal\\ndramatically increased the size and scope of the federal government, including more executive agencies.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\n:\\u200a211\\u201312\\nThe traditionally small presidential staff was greatly expanded, with the\\nExecutive Office of the President\\nbeing created in 1939, none of whom require Senate confirmation.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\n:\\u200a229\\u2013231\\nRoosevelt's unprecedented re-election to a third and fourth term, the victory of the United States in\\nWorld War II\\n, and the nation's growing economy all helped established the office as a position of global leadership.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\n:\\u200a269\\nHis successors,\\nHarry Truman\\nand\\nDwight D.

Johnson\\nlost popular support due to the\\nVietnam War\\nand\\nRichard Nixon\\n's presidency collapsed in the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, Congress enacted a series of reforms intended to reassert itself.\\n[\\n50\\n]\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nThese included the\\nWar Powers Resolution\\n, enacted over Nixon's veto in 1973,\\n[\\n52\\n]\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nand the\\nCongressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974\\nthat sought to strengthen congressional fiscal powers.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nBy 1976,\\nGerald Ford\\nconceded that \\\"the historic pendulum\\\" had swung toward Congress, raising the possibility of a \\\"disruptive\\\" erosion of his ability to govern.\\n[\\n55\\n]\\nFord failed to win election to a full term and his successor,\\nJimmy Carter\\n, failed to win re-election.\\nRonald Reagan\\n, who had been an actor before beginning his political career, used his talent as a communicator to help reshape the American agenda away from New Deal policies toward more conservative ideology.\\n[\\n56\\n]\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nAfter the Cold War, the United States became the world's undisputed leading power.\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nBill Clinton\\n,\\nGeorge W.

Meanwhile, the nation gradually became more politically polarized, leading to the ascendency of increasingly polarized Congressmembers, especially following the\\n1994 mid-term elections\\nwhich saw Republicans control the House for the first time in 40 years, and the rise of routine\\nfilibusters\\nin the Senate.\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nRecent presidents have thus increasingly focused on\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to implement major policies, at the expense of legislation and congressional power.\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nPresidential elections in the 21st century have reflected this continuing polarization, with no candidate except Obama in 2008 winning by more than five percent of the popular vote and two, George W.

Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nPresident\\nLyndon B. Johnson\\nsigns the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act\\nat the\\nWhite House\\non July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\nand others look on.\\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the\\nPresentment Clause\\n, which gives the president the power to veto any\\nbill\\npassed by\\nCongress\\n. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\nof both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.  The veto \\u2013 or threat of a veto \\u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\nSign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill\\nbecomes law\\n.\\nVeto\\nthe legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\n.\\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto\\n.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the\\nLine Item Veto Act\\n. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In\\nClinton v. City of New York\\n,\\n524\\nU.S.\\n417\\n(1998), the\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nSetting the agenda\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump\\ndelivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore\\nCongress\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \\\"necessary and expedient\\\". This is done through the constitutionally-based\\nState of the Union\\naddress, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nPresidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of\\nagencies\\nthat can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\\"virtual army of 'czars'\\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\\".\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nPresidents have been criticized for making\\nsigning statements\\nwhen signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nThis practice has been criticized by the\\nAmerican Bar Association\\nas unconstitutional.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nConservative commentator\\nGeorge Will\\nwrote of an \\\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\\" and \\\"the eclipse of Congress\\\".\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by\\nArticle II, Section\\n3\\nof the Constitution to call a\\nspecial session\\nof one or both houses of Congress. Since\\nJohn Adams\\nfirst did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions.\\nHarry S. Truman\\nwas the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the\\nTurnip Day Session\\n. In addition, prior to ratification of the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\nin 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly\\ninaugurated\\npresidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nExecutive powers\\nMain article:\\nPowers of the president of the United States\\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

However, these nominations require\\nSenate confirmation\\nbefore they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to\\nU.S. district courts\\n, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of\\nsenatorial courtesy\\n. Presidents may also grant\\npardons\\nand\\nreprieves\\n.\\nGerald Ford\\npardoned\\nRichard Nixon\\na month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when\\nBill Clinton\\npardoned\\nPatty Hearst\\non his last day in office; this is often\\ncontroversial\\n.\\n[\\n98\\n]\\n[\\n99\\n]\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is\\nexecutive privilege\\n, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see\\nChief Justice\\nJohn Jay\\n's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain\\n. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nUnited States v. Nixon\\n, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the\\nLewinsky scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nClinton v. Jones\\n, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the\\nlegal precedent\\nthat executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nThe\\nstate secrets privilege\\nallows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from\\ndiscovery\\nin legal proceedings if such release would harm\\nnational security\\n. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when\\nThomas Jefferson\\nrefused to release military documents in the\\ntreason\\ntrial of\\nAaron Burr\\nand again in\\nTotten v. United States\\n, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHowever, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until\\nUnited States v. Reynolds\\n, where it was held to be a\\ncommon law\\nevidentiary\\nprivilege.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nBefore the\\nSeptember 11 attacks\\n, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nSince 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the\\nNinth Circuit\\n's ruling in\\nMohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nCritics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has\\nabsolute immunity\\nfrom court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions.\\nNixon v. Fitzgerald\\n(1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions.\\nClinton v. Jones\\n(1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019\\nMueller report\\non Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible\\nobstruction of justice\\n, but investigators declined to refer\\nDonald Trump\\nfor prosecution based on a\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\npolicy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy.

Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration\\npublic relations\\nofficials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\\"propagandized leadership\\\" which has a \\\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\\".\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nAdministration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops\\nof smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nOne critic wrote the image of John F.

With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party's voters.  Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The\\ncoattail effect\\n, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.  Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\nGlobal leader\\nWith the rise of the United States as a\\nsuperpower\\nin the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of\\nNATO\\n, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the\\nEuropean Union\\n, have led to the moniker that the president is the \\\"\\nleader of the free world\\n\\\".\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5\\nof the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\nbe a\\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\\n;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a\\nresident in the United States\\nfor at least 14 years.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 7\\n, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nUnder\\nSection 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment\\n, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nThere is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding\\nConfederates\\nfrom public office after the Civil War.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nUnder the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nPrior experience\\nMain articles:\\nList of presidents of the United States by other offices held\\n,\\nList of presidents of the United States by previous experience\\n, and\\nList of presidents of the United States by education\\nThere are no requirements for previous or concurrent offices held by the President or presidential candidates.

As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the\\nTwenty-third Amendment\\nprovides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.\\n[\\n136\\n]\\nCurrently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nIn all but two states, the party whose presidential\\u2013vice presidential\\nticket\\nreceives a\\nplurality\\nof popular votes in the state has its entire\\nslate\\nof elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nMaine\\nand\\nNebraska\\ndeviate from this\\nwinner-take-all\\npractice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each\\ncongressional district\\n.\\n[\\n139\\n]\\n[\\n140\\n]\\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the\\nparty\\nthat nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are\\npledged\\n.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nThe constitutionality of these laws was upheld in\\nChiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nFollowing the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an\\nabsolute majority\\nof electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the\\nHouse of Representatives\\nmust meet to elect a president using a\\ncontingent election\\nprocedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top\\nthree\\nelectoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\\u201373 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand fellow Democratic-Republican\\nAaron Burr\\nin the\\nelection of 1800\\nnecessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n3\\nof the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the\\nrunner-up\\nwould become vice president.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nOn February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the\\nTwelfth Amendment\\nin time to be used in the\\n1804 election\\n.\\n[\\n145\\n]\\nA quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the\\nelection of 1824\\n. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients:\\nAndrew Jackson\\n,\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\n, and\\nWilliam H. Crawford\\n. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.\\n[\\n146\\n]\\nInauguration\\nMain article:\\nUnited States presidential inauguration\\nPursuant to the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\n, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election.\\n[\\n147\\n]\\nThe first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as\\nInauguration Day\\n, were the\\nsecond terms\\nof President\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nand Vice President\\nJohn Nance Garner\\nin 1937.\\n[\\n148\\n]\\nPreviously, Inauguration Day was on March 4. As a result of the date change, the first term (1933\\u201337) of both men had been shortened by 43 days.\\n[\\n149\\n]\\nBefore executing the powers of the office, a president is required to\\nrecite\\nthe\\npresidential Oath of Office\\n, found in\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n8 of the Constitution\\n. This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution:\\nI do solemnly swear (or\\naffirm\\n) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nPresidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a\\nBible\\nwhile taking the oath, and have added \\\"So help me God\\\" to the end of the oath.\\n[\\n151\\n]\\n[\\n152\\n]\\nAlthough the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the\\nchief justice of the United States\\n.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nIncumbency\\nTerm limit\\nPresident\\nWilliam McKinley\\nand his vice presidential running mate, New York Governor\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\n,\\nc.\\n1900\\nFranklin D.

Precedent became tradition after\\nThomas Jefferson\\npublicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors,\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nJames Monroe\\n.\\n[\\n153\\n]\\nIn spite of the strong two-term tradition,\\nUlysses S. Grant\\nsought nomination at the\\n1880 Republican National Convention\\nfor a non-consecutive third term, but was unsuccessful.\\n[\\n154\\n]\\nIn 1940, after leading the nation through the\\nGreat Depression\\nand focused on supporting U.S.\\nallied nations\\nat war with the\\nAxis powers\\n, Franklin Roosevelt was elected to a third term, breaking the long-standing precedent. Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in\\nWorld War II\\n, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nIn response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\nwas\\nadopted\\nin 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term.\\nHarry S. Truman\\n, the president at the time it was submitted to the states by the Congress, was exempted from its limitations. Without the exemption, he would not have been eligible to run for a second full term in 1952 (which he briefly sought), as he had served nearly all of Franklin Roosevelt's unexpired 1945\\u20131949 term and had been elected to a full four-year term beginning in 1949.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nVacancies and succession\\nUnder\\nSection\\n1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment\\n, ratified in 1967, the vice president becomes president upon the\\nremoval from office\\n, death, or resignation of the president. Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession),\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6\\n, stated only that the vice president assumes the \\\"powers and duties\\\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nUnder this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply\\nact\\nas president,\\n[\\n157\\n]\\npotentially resulting in a\\nspecial election\\n. Upon the death of President\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nin 1841, Vice President\\nJohn Tyler\\ndeclared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \\\"Acting President\\\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\\\".\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nThe\\nPresidential Succession Act\\nof 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C. \\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the\\npresidential line of succession\\nfollows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments\\nwho form the president's\\ncabinet\\n. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nDeclarations of inability\\nMain article:\\nTwenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes\\nacting president\\n, by transmitting to the\\nspeaker of the House\\nand the\\npresident\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate\\na statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by\\nRonald Reagan\\n(once),\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n(twice), and\\nJoe Biden\\n(once), each in anticipation of surgery.\\n[\\n159\\n]\\n[\\n160\\n]\\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment also provides that the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the\\nCabinet\\n, may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration, to the speaker of the House and the president\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate, to the effect that the president is unable to discharge his or her powers and duties. If the president then declares that no such inability exist, he or she resumes the presidential powers unless the vice president and Cabinet make a second declaration of presidential inability, in which case Congress decides the question.\\nRemoval\\nMain articles:\\nList of efforts to impeach presidents of the United States\\n,\\nFederal impeachment in the United States\\n, and\\nFederal impeachment trial in the United States\\nArticle II, Section 4\\nof the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \\\"\\ntreason\\n,\\nbribery\\n, or other\\nhigh crimes and misdemeanors\\n\\\".\\nArticle I, Section 2, Clause\\n5\\nauthorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a \\\"\\ngrand jury\\n\\\" with the power to impeach said officials by a majority vote.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause\\n6\\nauthorizes the Senate to serve as a\\ncourt\\nwith the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict.\\n[\\n162\\n]\\nThree presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in\\n1868\\n, Bill Clinton in\\n1998\\n, and Donald Trump in\\n2019\\nand\\n2021\\n; none have been convicted by the Senate. Additionally, the\\nHouse Judiciary Committee\\nconducted an impeachment inquiry against Richard Nixon in\\n1973\\u201374\\nand reported  three articles of impeachment to the House of Representatives for final action; however, he resigned from office before the House voted on them.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nCircumvention of authority\\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the part of the president, or with a long-term disability. In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders. This has ranged from\\nRichard Nixon\\n's Chief of Staff not transmitting orders to the Cabinet due to the president's heavy drinking, to staff removing memos from\\nDonald Trump\\n's desk.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nDecades before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a\\nstroke that left him partly incapacitated\\n.

When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nFormer presidents who served in Congress may also collect\\ncongressional pensions\\n.\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nThe act also provides former presidents with travel funds and\\nfranking\\nprivileges.\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.\\n[\\n189\\n]\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nIn 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nOn January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him,\\nGeorge W.

In some cases (such as with Nixon), the presidential library is adjacent to one of the president's former homes, where in other cases, such as with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, the presidential library and the historic site are in different cities entirely.\\nPolitical affiliation\\nPolitical parties\\nhave dominated\\nAmerican politics\\nfor most of the nation's history. Though the\\nFounding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless.

Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and unconstitutional, and no president in the past 35 years has filed a report \\\"pursuant\\\" to these triggering provisions.\\n^\\na\\nb\\nc\\nd\\n\\\"The Law: The President's War Powers\\\"\\n.\\nTime\\n.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown. But the increase in reported cases is indicative of greater willingness to assert the privilege than in the past.\\n^\\nSavage, Charlie (September 8, 2010).\\n\\\"Court Dismisses a Case Asserting Torture by C.I.A.\\\"\\nThe New York Times\\n.

The new government did not commence until the old government expired. It is apparent that the government did not commence on the Constitution's being ratified by the ninth state, for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognized by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members. It existed potentially until March 2, the day preceding that on which the members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\\\"\\nOwings v.

The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's\\nmost expensive military\\n, which has the\\nsecond-largest nuclear arsenal\\n.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of\\nseparation of powers\\n,\\nArticle I, Section\\n7\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or\\nveto\\nfederal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is\\nelected indirectly\\nthrough the\\nElectoral College\\nto a four-year term, along with the\\nvice president\\n. Under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a\\npresident's intra-term death\\nor\\nresignation\\n.\\n[\\nC\\n]\\nIn all,\\n45 individuals\\nhave served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.\\n[\\nD\\n]\\nDonald Trump\\nis the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\nIn July 1776, the\\nThirteen Colonies\\n, represented at the\\nSecond Continental Congress\\nin\\nPhiladelphia\\n, unanimously adopted the\\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\\nin which the colonies declared themselves to be independent\\nsovereign states\\nand no longer under\\nBritish\\nrule.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe affirmation was made in the\\nDeclaration of Independence\\n, which was written predominantly by\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the\\nBritish\\n,\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nthe Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates\\ntogether. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nCongress finished work on the\\nArticles of Confederation\\nto establish a\\nperpetual union\\nbetween the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for\\nratification\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nUnder the Articles, which\\ntook effect\\non March 1, 1781, the\\nCongress of the Confederation\\nwas a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThis institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of\\nCrown\\nand\\nParliament\\nought to have functioned with respect to the royal\\ndominion\\n: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly\\nroyal prerogatives\\n(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a\\npresident of the United States in Congress Assembled\\nto preside over its deliberation as a neutral\\ndiscussion moderator\\n. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1783, the\\nTreaty of Paris\\nsecured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nBy 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their\\nhard currency\\npouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their\\nMediterranean\\ncommerce preyed upon by\\nNorth African\\npirates\\n, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nCivil and political unrest loomed.  Events such as the\\nNewburgh Conspiracy\\nand\\nShays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between\\nVirginia\\nand Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference\\nin 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in\\nAnnapolis, Maryland\\n, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the\\nconvention\\nfailed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states,\\nAlexander Hamilton\\nof New York led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in\\nPhiladelphia\\n.

Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nNew York\\noffered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIt was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the\\nU.S. Constitution\\nemerged.\\n1789\\u20131933\\nGeorge Washington\\n, the first president of the United States\\nAs the nation's first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\nestablished many norms that would come to define the office.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nHis decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the\\nTwenty-Second Amendment\\n.

Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nPresident\\nLyndon B. Johnson\\nsigns the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act\\nat the\\nWhite House\\non July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\nand others look on.\\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the\\nPresentment Clause\\n, which gives the president the power to veto any\\nbill\\npassed by\\nCongress\\n. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\nof both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.  The veto \\u2013 or threat of a veto \\u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\nSign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill\\nbecomes law\\n.\\nVeto\\nthe legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\n.\\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto\\n.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the\\nLine Item Veto Act\\n. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In\\nClinton v. City of New York\\n,\\n524\\nU.S.\\n417\\n(1998), the\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nSetting the agenda\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump\\ndelivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore\\nCongress\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \\\"necessary and expedient\\\". This is done through the constitutionally-based\\nState of the Union\\naddress, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nPresidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of\\nagencies\\nthat can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\\"virtual army of 'czars'\\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\\".\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nPresidents have been criticized for making\\nsigning statements\\nwhen signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nThis practice has been criticized by the\\nAmerican Bar Association\\nas unconstitutional.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nConservative commentator\\nGeorge Will\\nwrote of an \\\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\\" and \\\"the eclipse of Congress\\\".\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by\\nArticle II, Section\\n3\\nof the Constitution to call a\\nspecial session\\nof one or both houses of Congress. Since\\nJohn Adams\\nfirst did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions.\\nHarry S. Truman\\nwas the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the\\nTurnip Day Session\\n. In addition, prior to ratification of the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\nin 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly\\ninaugurated\\npresidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nExecutive powers\\nMain article:\\nPowers of the president of the United States\\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

When the president is lawfully exercising one of the constitutionally conferred presidential responsibilities, the scope of this power is broad.\\n[\\n82\\n]\\nEven so, these directives are subject to\\njudicial review\\nby U.S. federal courts, which can find them to be unconstitutional.

The first is\\nexecutive privilege\\n, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see\\nChief Justice\\nJohn Jay\\n's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain\\n. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nUnited States v. Nixon\\n, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the\\nLewinsky scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nClinton v. Jones\\n, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the\\nlegal precedent\\nthat executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nThe\\nstate secrets privilege\\nallows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from\\ndiscovery\\nin legal proceedings if such release would harm\\nnational security\\n. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when\\nThomas Jefferson\\nrefused to release military documents in the\\ntreason\\ntrial of\\nAaron Burr\\nand again in\\nTotten v. United States\\n, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHowever, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until\\nUnited States v. Reynolds\\n, where it was held to be a\\ncommon law\\nevidentiary\\nprivilege.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nBefore the\\nSeptember 11 attacks\\n, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nSince 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the\\nNinth Circuit\\n's ruling in\\nMohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nCritics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has\\nabsolute immunity\\nfrom court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions.\\nNixon v. Fitzgerald\\n(1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions.\\nClinton v. Jones\\n(1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019\\nMueller report\\non Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible\\nobstruction of justice\\n, but investigators declined to refer\\nDonald Trump\\nfor prosecution based on a\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\npolicy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy. As of October 2019, a case was pending in the federal courts regarding access to personal tax returns in a criminal case brought against Donald Trump by the\\nNew York County District Attorney\\nalleging violations of New York state law.\\n[\\n109\\n]\\nMemoranda from the\\nOffice of Legal Counsel\\nissued in 1973 and 2000 internally prohibit the Department of Justice from prosecuting a president, which some legal scholars have criticized but others have endorsed.\\n[\\n110\\n]\\nIn defense against federal criminal prosecution for his\\nalleged 2020 election subversion\\n, in January 2024, Trump argued to the\\nDC Circuit Court of Appeals\\nthat a president enjoys absolute immunity for criminal acts conducted while in office. The next month, a three-judge panel of the court unanimously ruled against Trump. It was the first time an appeals court had addressed such a presidential immunity matter, since no other sitting or former president had ever been criminally indicted.\\n[\\n111\\n]\\nIn\\nTrump v. United States\\n, on July 1, 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents were entitled to absolute immunity from exercising core powers enumerated by the Constitution,\\npresumption\\nof immunity for other official acts, and no immunity for unofficial actions. The case was sent back to lower courts to determine which actions in the criminal complaint should be classified as official vs. unofficial.\\n[\\n112\\n]\\nThe ruling was the first time the courts granted a president criminal immunity.\\nLeadership roles\\nHead of state\\nFour ruffles and flourishes and 'Hail to the Chief' (long version)\\nProblems playing this file? See\\nmedia help\\n.\\nAs\\nhead of state\\n, the president represents the United States government to its own people and represents the nation to the rest of the world. For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a\\nState Arrival Ceremony\\nheld on the\\nSouth Lawn\\n, a custom begun by\\nJohn F. Kennedy\\nin 1961.\\n[\\n113\\n]\\nThis is followed by a\\nstate dinner\\ngiven by the president which is held in the\\nState Dining Room\\nlater in the evening.\\n[\\n114\\n]\\nPresident\\nWoodrow Wilson\\nthrows out the ceremonial first ball on\\nOpening Day\\nin 1916\\nPresident\\nBill Clinton\\nreviews honor guards at\\nBuckingham Palace\\nduring a 1995 state visit to the UK\\nAs a national leader, the president also fulfills many less formal ceremonial duties. For example,\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\nstarted the tradition of throwing out the\\nceremonial first pitch\\nin 1910 at\\nGriffith Stadium\\n, Washington, D.C., on the\\nWashington Senators's\\nOpening Day\\n. Every president since Taft, except for\\nJimmy Carter\\n, threw out at least one ceremonial first ball or pitch for Opening Day, the\\nAll-Star Game\\n, or the\\nWorld Series\\n, usually with much fanfare.\\n[\\n115\\n]\\nEvery president since\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\nhas served as honorary president of the\\nBoy Scouts of America\\n.\\n[\\n116\\n]\\nOther presidential traditions are associated with American holidays.\\nRutherford B.

Since 1989, when the custom of \\\"pardoning\\\" the turkey was formalized by\\nGeorge H. W. Bush\\n, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.\\n[\\n118\\n]\\nPresidential traditions also involve the president's role as head of government. Many outgoing presidents since\\nJames Buchanan\\ntraditionally give advice to their successor during the\\npresidential transition\\n.\\n[\\n119\\n]\\nRonald Reagan\\nand his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on\\nInauguration Day\\nfor the incoming president.\\n[\\n120\\n]\\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration\\npublic relations\\nofficials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\\"propagandized leadership\\\" which has a \\\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\\".\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nAdministration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops\\nof smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nOne critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \\\"in rich detail\\\" which \\\"drew on the power of myth\\\" regarding the incident of\\nPT 109\\n[\\n123\\n]\\nand wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.\\n[\\n124\\n]\\nAs a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \\\"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\\\".\\n[\\n125\\n]\\nHead of party\\nThe president is typically considered to be the\\nde facto\\nhead and spokesperson of their political party.  With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party's voters.  Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The\\ncoattail effect\\n, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.  Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\nGlobal leader\\nWith the rise of the United States as a\\nsuperpower\\nin the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of\\nNATO\\n, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the\\nEuropean Union\\n, have led to the moniker that the president is the \\\"\\nleader of the free world\\n\\\".\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5\\nof the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\nbe a\\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\\n;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a\\nresident in the United States\\nfor at least 14 years.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 7\\n, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nUnder\\nSection 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment\\n, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nThere is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding\\nConfederates\\nfrom public office after the Civil War.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nUnder the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nPrior experience\\nMain articles:\\nList of presidents of the United States by other offices held\\n,\\nList of presidents of the United States by previous experience\\n, and\\nList of presidents of the United States by education\\nThere are no requirements for previous or concurrent offices held by the President or presidential candidates.

There has never been a property qualification for the Presidency or other federal offices, but, in the early years of the republic, there were\\nproperty qualifications for voting\\nor for some of the stepping-stone offices to the Presidency (particularly governorships).  Prior to the Civil War, it was common for presidents to be men of significant property: Presidents from the North tended to own small farms, while several Southern presidents owned plantations and\\nslaves\\n.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n[\\n135\\n]\\nWhile several later presidents came from abject poverty, others, such as the Roosevelts, John Kennedy, and Donald Trump, were parties to extensive family fortunes.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n33 of the 45 men who served as President, including every president since 1953 and all but one since 1901, have had a bachelor's degree.

As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the\\nTwenty-third Amendment\\nprovides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.\\n[\\n136\\n]\\nCurrently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nIn all but two states, the party whose presidential\\u2013vice presidential\\nticket\\nreceives a\\nplurality\\nof popular votes in the state has its entire\\nslate\\nof elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nMaine\\nand\\nNebraska\\ndeviate from this\\nwinner-take-all\\npractice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each\\ncongressional district\\n.\\n[\\n139\\n]\\n[\\n140\\n]\\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the\\nparty\\nthat nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are\\npledged\\n.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nThe constitutionality of these laws was upheld in\\nChiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nFollowing the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an\\nabsolute majority\\nof electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the\\nHouse of Representatives\\nmust meet to elect a president using a\\ncontingent election\\nprocedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top\\nthree\\nelectoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\\u201373 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand fellow Democratic-Republican\\nAaron Burr\\nin the\\nelection of 1800\\nnecessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n3\\nof the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the\\nrunner-up\\nwould become vice president.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nOn February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the\\nTwelfth Amendment\\nin time to be used in the\\n1804 election\\n.\\n[\\n145\\n]\\nA quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the\\nelection of 1824\\n. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients:\\nAndrew Jackson\\n,\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\n, and\\nWilliam H. Crawford\\n. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.\\n[\\n146\\n]\\nInauguration\\nMain article:\\nUnited States presidential inauguration\\nPursuant to the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\n, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election.\\n[\\n147\\n]\\nThe first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as\\nInauguration Day\\n, were the\\nsecond terms\\nof President\\nFranklin D.

Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession),\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6\\n, stated only that the vice president assumes the \\\"powers and duties\\\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nUnder this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply\\nact\\nas president,\\n[\\n157\\n]\\npotentially resulting in a\\nspecial election\\n. Upon the death of President\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nin 1841, Vice President\\nJohn Tyler\\ndeclared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \\\"Acting President\\\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\\\".\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nThe\\nPresidential Succession Act\\nof 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C. \\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the\\npresidential line of succession\\nfollows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments\\nwho form the president's\\ncabinet\\n. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nDeclarations of inability\\nMain article:\\nTwenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes\\nacting president\\n, by transmitting to the\\nspeaker of the House\\nand the\\npresident\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate\\na statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by\\nRonald Reagan\\n(once),\\nGeorge W.

In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the\\nBoeing C-32\\n, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet. Any civilian aircraft the president is aboard is designated\\nExecutive One\\nfor the flight.\\n[\\n172\\n]\\nFor short-distance air travel, the president has access to a fleet of\\nU.S. Marine Corps\\nhelicopters of varying models, designated\\nMarine One\\nwhen the president is aboard any particular one in the fleet.

Prominent examples include\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\n's tenure as\\nchief justice of the United States\\nand\\nHerbert Hoover\\n's work on government reorganization after\\nWorld War II\\n. Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House:\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwas elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for 17 years, and\\nAndrew Johnson\\nreturned to the Senate in 1875, though he died soon after. Some ex-presidents were very active, especially in international affairs, most notably Theodore Roosevelt;\\n[\\n178\\n]\\nHerbert Hoover;\\n[\\n179\\n]\\nRichard Nixon;\\n[\\n180\\n]\\nand Jimmy Carter.\\n[\\n181\\n]\\n[\\n182\\n]\\nEarlier presidents returned to their hometowns to lead charitable work there, or supervised farm work on their farms or plantations, many of which had been neglected during their presidencies.\\nThomas Jefferson\\nfounded the\\nUniversity of Virginia\\nduring his post-presidency, and, following his death, was succeeded as rector by\\nJames Madison\\n.  Madison and\\nJames Monroe\\nparticipated in the drafting of one version of the\\nVirginia Constitution\\n, while\\nJohn Tyler\\nserved at the Confederate Constitution and in the Confederate Congress.\\nPresidents may use their predecessors as emissaries to deliver private messages to other nations or as official representatives of the United States to state funerals and other important foreign events.\\n[\\n183\\n]\\n[\\n184\\n]\\nRichard Nixon made multiple foreign trips to countries including China and Russia and was lauded as an elder statesman.\\n[\\n185\\n]\\nDuring his post-presidency\\n,\\nJimmy Carter\\nbecame a global\\nhuman rights\\ncampaigner, international arbiter, and election monitor, as well as a recipient of the\\nNobel Peace Prize\\n. Bill Clinton also worked as an informal ambassador, most recently in the negotiations that led to the release of two American\\njournalists\\n,\\nLaura Ling\\nand\\nEuna Lee\\n, from\\nNorth Korea\\n. During his presidency, George W. Bush called on former presidents George H. W. Bush and Clinton to assist with humanitarian efforts after the\\n2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami\\n. President Obama followed suit by asking presidents Clinton and George W. Bush to lead efforts to aid Haiti after an\\nearthquake\\ndevastated that country in 2010.  Clinton's relationship with the two Bushes is not the first friendship between former presidents: Carter enjoyed a friendship and correspondence with\\nGerald Ford\\n, while Jefferson and\\nJohn Adams\\nhad an extended correspondence through letters in their post-presidencies.\\nClinton has been active politically since his presidential term ended\\n, working with his wife\\nHillary\\non her\\n2008\\nand\\n2016\\npresidential bids and President Obama on his\\n2012 reelection campaign\\n. Obama has also been active politically since his presidential term ended, having worked with his former vice president\\nJoe Biden\\non his\\n2020 election campaign\\nand Biden's vice president\\nKamala Harris\\non her\\n2024 election campaign\\nafter President Biden\\nwithdrew his bid for re-election\\n.\\nAfter losing his bid for the presidency in 2020, Trump remained politically active and was an outspoken critic of his successor and the Democratic Party. He also contended with four criminal cases. Trump announced his fourth bid to the presidency in 2022, ultimately becoming the nominee of his party for the third time and won a second presidential term in 2024.\\nGrover Cleveland\\nwas also elected to nonconsecutive terms; his reelection bid failed in\\n1888\\nbut succeeded in\\n1892\\n.\\nPension and other benefits\\nThe\\nFormer Presidents Act\\n(FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection; also provided is funding for a certain number of staff and for office expenses.  The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff.  The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by\\nimpeachment\\n.\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nAccording to a 2008 report by the\\nCongressional Research Service\\n:\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nChief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nFormer presidents who served in Congress may also collect\\ncongressional pensions\\n.\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nThe act also provides former presidents with travel funds and\\nfranking\\nprivileges.\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.\\n[\\n189\\n]\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nIn 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nOn January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him,\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n, and all subsequent presidents.\\n[\\n192\\n]\\nA\\nfirst spouse\\nwho remarries is no longer eligible for Secret Service protection.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nWriting\\nMain article:\\nList of autobiographies by presidents of the United States\\nSince the publication of\\nUlysses S. Grant\\n's\\nPersonal Memoirs\\nin 1885, most presidents, including every president who survived to the end of their term from Calvin Coolidge to Barack Obama, has written at least one autobiography.  These autobiographies serve two purposes: to ensure the First Family's financial security (Clinton made over $30 million dollars from writing two books\\n[\\n193\\n]\\n), but also to defend or rehabilitate presidential legacies.\\nPresidential libraries and historic sites\\nMain articles:\\nPresidential library system\\nand\\nList of residences of presidents of the United States\\nThe homes where U.S. presidents were born, lived or vacationed have frequently been preserved as\\nhouse museums\\nand listed as\\nNational Historic Sites\\nor on\\nU.S. National Register of Historic Places\\n.\\nFrom left to right: Presidents\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nGeorge W.

Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the\\nNational Archives and Records Administration\\n(NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.\\n[\\n194\\n]\\nThere are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, including:\\nThe\\nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the State of\\nIllinois\\n;\\nThe\\nGeorge W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by\\nSouthern Methodist University\\n;\\nThe\\nGeorge H. W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by\\nTexas A&M University\\n; and\\nThe\\nLyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the\\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\\n.\\nSeveral former presidents have overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document:\\nThe\\nHarry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nIndependence, Missouri\\n;\\nThe\\nDwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home\\nin\\nAbilene, Kansas\\n;\\nThe\\nRichard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nYorba Linda, California\\n; and\\nThe\\nRonald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nSimi Valley, California\\n.\\nThese gravesites are open to the general public.  In some cases (such as with Nixon), the presidential library is adjacent to one of the president's former homes, where in other cases, such as with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, the presidential library and the historic site are in different cities entirely.\\nPolitical affiliation\\nPolitical parties\\nhave dominated\\nAmerican politics\\nfor most of the nation's history. Though the\\nFounding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from\\npolitical factions\\n, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the\\nWashington administration\\nwere referred to as \\\"pro-administration\\\" and would eventually form the\\nFederalist Party\\n, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\n.\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained\\nunaffiliated\\nwith any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.\\n[\\n196\\n]\\n[\\n197\\n]\\nSince Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office, and, since 1869, every president has been a member of either the\\nRepublican\\nor\\nDemocratic\\nParties.\\n[\\n198\\n]\\n[\\n199\\n]\\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\\nParty\\nNumber of\\npresidents\\nName(s)\\nRepublican\\n19\\nChester\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Arthur\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0H.\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nCalvin\\u00a0Coolidge\\n,\\nDwight\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Eisenhower\\n,\\nGerald\\u00a0Ford\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Garfield\\n,\\nUlysses\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Grant\\n,\\nWarren\\u00a0G.\\u00a0Harding\\n,\\nBenjamin\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nRutherford\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Hayes\\n,\\nHerbert\\u00a0Hoover\\n,\\nAbraham\\u00a0Lincoln\\n,\\n[\\nG\\n]\\nWilliam\\u00a0McKinley\\n,\\nRichard\\u00a0Nixon\\n,\\nRonald\\u00a0Reagan\\n,\\nTheodore\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Howard\\u00a0Taft\\n, and\\nDonald\\u00a0Trump\\n(incumbent)\\nDemocratic\\n15\\nJoe Biden\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Buchanan\\n,\\nJimmy\\u00a0Carter\\n,\\nGrover\\u00a0Cleveland\\n,\\nBill\\u00a0Clinton\\n,\\nAndrew\\u00a0Jackson\\n,\\nLyndon\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Johnson\\n,\\nJohn\\u00a0F.\\u00a0Kennedy\\n,\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0Pierce\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0K.\\u00a0Polk\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nHarry\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Truman\\n,\\nMartin\\u00a0Van\\u00a0Buren\\n, and\\nWoodrow\\u00a0Wilson\\nDemocratic-Republican\\n4\\nJohn\\u00a0Quincy\\u00a0Adams\\n,\\nThomas\\u00a0Jefferson\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Madison\\n, and\\nJames\\u00a0Monroe\\nWhig\\n4\\nMillard\\u00a0Fillmore\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Henry\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nZachary\\u00a0Taylor\\n, and\\nJohn\\u00a0Tyler\\n[\\nH\\n]\\nFederalist\\n1\\nJohn\\u00a0Adams\\nNational Union\\n1\\nAndrew\\u00a0Johnson\\n[\\nI\\n]\\nIndependent\\n(No party)\\n1\\nGeorge\\u00a0Washington\\nTimeline of presidents\\nSee also:\\nList of presidents of the United States\\nThe following\\ntimeline\\ndepicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.\\nSee also\\nUnited States portal\\nPolitics portal\\nOutline of American politics\\nNotes\\n^\\nIn addition to $100,000 in travel reimbursement, $19,000 for entertainment and $50,000 for additional expenses.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\n^\\nThe informal term POTUS originated in the\\nPhillips Code\\n, a shorthand method created in 1879 by\\nWalter P.

Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

The new government did not commence until the old government expired.

In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members. It existed potentially until March 2, the day preceding that on which the members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\\\"\\nOwings v.

The president directs the\\nexecutive branch\\nof the\\nfederal government\\nand is the\\ncommander-in-chief\\nof the\\nUnited States Armed Forces\\n.\\nThe power of the presidency has grown\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nsince the first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\n, took office in 1789.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nWhile presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasing role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with some expansions during the presidencies of\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nand\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining\\nsuperpower\\n.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nAs the leader of the nation with the\\nlargest economy by nominal GDP\\n, the president possesses significant domestic and international\\nhard\\nand\\nsoft power\\n. For much of the 20th century, especially during the\\nCold War\\n, the U.S. president was often called \\\"the leader of the free world\\\".\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nArticle II of the Constitution\\nestablishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's\\nmost expensive military\\n, which has the\\nsecond-largest nuclear arsenal\\n.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of\\nseparation of powers\\n,\\nArticle I, Section\\n7\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or\\nveto\\nfederal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is\\nelected indirectly\\nthrough the\\nElectoral College\\nto a four-year term, along with the\\nvice president\\n. Under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a\\npresident's intra-term death\\nor\\nresignation\\n.\\n[\\nC\\n]\\nIn all,\\n45 individuals\\nhave served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.\\n[\\nD\\n]\\nDonald Trump\\nis the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\nIn July 1776, the\\nThirteen Colonies\\n, represented at the\\nSecond Continental Congress\\nin\\nPhiladelphia\\n, unanimously adopted the\\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\\nin which the colonies declared themselves to be independent\\nsovereign states\\nand no longer under\\nBritish\\nrule.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe affirmation was made in the\\nDeclaration of Independence\\n, which was written predominantly by\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the\\nBritish\\n,\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nthe Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates\\ntogether. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nCongress finished work on the\\nArticles of Confederation\\nto establish a\\nperpetual union\\nbetween the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for\\nratification\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nUnder the Articles, which\\ntook effect\\non March 1, 1781, the\\nCongress of the Confederation\\nwas a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThis institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of\\nCrown\\nand\\nParliament\\nought to have functioned with respect to the royal\\ndominion\\n: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly\\nroyal prerogatives\\n(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a\\npresident of the United States in Congress Assembled\\nto preside over its deliberation as a neutral\\ndiscussion moderator\\n. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1783, the\\nTreaty of Paris\\nsecured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nBy 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their\\nhard currency\\npouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their\\nMediterranean\\ncommerce preyed upon by\\nNorth African\\npirates\\n, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nCivil and political unrest loomed.  Events such as the\\nNewburgh Conspiracy\\nand\\nShays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between\\nVirginia\\nand Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference\\nin 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in\\nAnnapolis, Maryland\\n, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the\\nconvention\\nfailed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states,\\nAlexander Hamilton\\nof New York led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in\\nPhiladelphia\\n. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nEdmund Randolph\\nsucceeded in securing\\nGeorge Washington\\n's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nWhen the\\nConstitutional Convention\\nconvened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (\\nRhode Island\\ndid not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nNew York\\noffered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIt was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the\\nU.S. Constitution\\nemerged.\\n1789\\u20131933\\nGeorge Washington\\n, the first president of the United States\\nAs the nation's first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\nestablished many norms that would come to define the office.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nHis decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the\\nTwenty-Second Amendment\\n. By the end of his presidency, political parties had developed,\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nwith\\nJohn Adams\\ndefeating\\nThomas Jefferson\\nin 1796, the first truly contested presidential election.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nAfter Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow Virginians\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nJames Monroe\\nwould each serve two terms, eventually dominating the nation's politics during the\\nEra of Good Feelings\\nuntil Adams' son\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwon election in 1824 after the\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\nsplit.\\nThe election of\\nAndrew Jackson\\nin 1828 was a significant milestone, as Jackson was not part of the Virginia and Massachusetts elite that had held the presidency for its first 40 years.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nJacksonian democracy\\nsought to strengthen the presidency at the expense of Congress, while broadening public participation as the nation rapidly expanded westward. However, his successor,\\nMartin Van Buren\\n, became unpopular after the\\nPanic of 1837\\n,\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nand the death of\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nand subsequent poor relations between\\nJohn Tyler\\nand Congress led to further weakening of the office.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nIncluding Van Buren, in the 24 years between 1837 and 1861, six presidential terms would be filled by eight different men, with none serving two terms.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nThe Senate played an important role during this period, with the\\nGreat Triumvirate\\nof\\nHenry Clay\\n,\\nDaniel Webster\\n, and\\nJohn C. Calhoun\\nplaying key roles in shaping national policy in the 1830s and 1840s until debates over slavery began pulling the nation apart in the 1850s.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nAbraham Lincoln\\n's leadership during the\\nCivil War\\nhas led historians to regard him as one of the nation's greatest presidents.\\n[\\nE\\n]\\nThe circumstances of the war and Republican domination of Congress made the office very powerful,\\n[\\n37\\n]\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nand Lincoln's re-election in 1864 was the first time a president had been re-elected since Jackson in 1832. After Lincoln's assassination, his successor\\nAndrew Johnson\\nlost all political support\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nand was nearly removed from office,\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nwith Congress remaining powerful during the two-term presidency of Civil War general\\nUlysses S. Grant\\n. After the end of\\nReconstruction\\n,\\nGrover Cleveland\\nwould eventually become the first Democratic president elected since before the war, running in three consecutive elections (1884, 1888, 1892) and winning twice. In 1900,\\nWilliam McKinley\\nbecame the first incumbent to win re-election since Grant in 1872.\\nAfter McKinley's\\nassassination\\nby\\nLeon Czolgosz\\nin 1901,\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\nbecame a dominant figure in American politics.\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nHistorians believe Roosevelt permanently changed the political system by strengthening the presidency,\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nwith some key accomplishments including breaking up trusts, conservationism, labor reforms, making personal character as important as the issues, and hand-picking his successor,\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\n. The following decade,\\nWoodrow Wilson\\nled the nation to victory during\\nWorld War I\\n, although Wilson's proposal for the\\nLeague of Nations\\nwas rejected by the Senate.\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nWarren Harding\\n, while popular in office, would see his legacy tarnished by scandals, especially\\nTeapot Dome\\n,\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nand\\nHerbert Hoover\\nquickly became very unpopular after failing to alleviate the\\nGreat Depression\\n.\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nImperial presidency\\nMain article:\\nImperial presidency\\nPresident\\nFranklin D.

Johnson\\nlost popular support due to the\\nVietnam War\\nand\\nRichard Nixon\\n's presidency collapsed in the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, Congress enacted a series of reforms intended to reassert itself.\\n[\\n50\\n]\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nThese included the\\nWar Powers Resolution\\n, enacted over Nixon's veto in 1973,\\n[\\n52\\n]\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nand the\\nCongressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974\\nthat sought to strengthen congressional fiscal powers.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nBy 1976,\\nGerald Ford\\nconceded that \\\"the historic pendulum\\\" had swung toward Congress, raising the possibility of a \\\"disruptive\\\" erosion of his ability to govern.\\n[\\n55\\n]\\nFord failed to win election to a full term and his successor,\\nJimmy Carter\\n, failed to win re-election.\\nRonald Reagan\\n, who had been an actor before beginning his political career, used his talent as a communicator to help reshape the American agenda away from New Deal policies toward more conservative ideology.\\n[\\n56\\n]\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nAfter the Cold War, the United States became the world's undisputed leading power.\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nBill Clinton\\n,\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n, and\\nBarack Obama\\neach served two terms as president. Meanwhile, the nation gradually became more politically polarized, leading to the ascendency of increasingly polarized Congressmembers, especially following the\\n1994 mid-term elections\\nwhich saw Republicans control the House for the first time in 40 years, and the rise of routine\\nfilibusters\\nin the Senate.\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nRecent presidents have thus increasingly focused on\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to implement major policies, at the expense of legislation and congressional power.\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nPresidential elections in the 21st century have reflected this continuing polarization, with no candidate except Obama in 2008 winning by more than five percent of the popular vote and two, George W. Bush (\\n2000\\n) and\\nDonald Trump\\n(\\n2016\\n), winning in the Electoral College while losing the popular vote.\\n[\\nF\\n]\\nBush (\\n2004\\n) and Trump (\\n2024\\n) were later re-elected, winning both in the Electoral College and the popular vote.\\nCritics of presidency's evolution\\nThe nation's\\nFounding Fathers\\nexpected the\\nCongress\\n, which was the first branch of government described in the\\nConstitution\\n, to be the dominant branch of government; they did not expect a strong executive department.\\n[\\n61\\n]\\nHowever, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful,\\n[\\n62\\n]\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nunchecked, unbalanced,\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nand \\\"monarchist\\\" in nature.\\n[\\n65\\n]\\nIn 2008 professor\\nDana D. Nelson\\nexpressed belief that presidents over the previous thirty years worked towards \\\"undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies\\\".\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nShe criticized proponents of the\\nunitary executive theory\\nfor expanding \\\"the many existing uncheckable executive powers\\u2014such as executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements\\u2014that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid, interference or consent from Congress\\\".\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nBill Wilson\\n, board member of\\nAmericans for Limited Government\\n, opined that the expanded presidency was \\\"the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule\\\".\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nLegislative powers\\nArticle I, Section\\n1\\nof the Constitution vests all\\nlawmaking power\\nin Congress's hands, and\\nArticle 1, Section 6, Clause\\n2\\nprevents the president (and all other executive branch officers) from simultaneously being a member of Congress. Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nPresident\\nLyndon B. Johnson\\nsigns the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act\\nat the\\nWhite House\\non July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\nand others look on.\\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the\\nPresentment Clause\\n, which gives the president the power to veto any\\nbill\\npassed by\\nCongress\\n. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\nof both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.  The veto \\u2013 or threat of a veto \\u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\nSign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill\\nbecomes law\\n.\\nVeto\\nthe legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\n.\\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto\\n.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the\\nLine Item Veto Act\\n. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In\\nClinton v. City of New York\\n,\\n524\\nU.S.\\n417\\n(1998), the\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nSetting the agenda\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump\\ndelivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore\\nCongress\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \\\"necessary and expedient\\\". This is done through the constitutionally-based\\nState of the Union\\naddress, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nPresidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of\\nagencies\\nthat can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\\"virtual army of 'czars'\\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\\".\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nPresidents have been criticized for making\\nsigning statements\\nwhen signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nThis practice has been criticized by the\\nAmerican Bar Association\\nas unconstitutional.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nConservative commentator\\nGeorge Will\\nwrote of an \\\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\\" and \\\"the eclipse of Congress\\\".\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by\\nArticle II, Section\\n3\\nof the Constitution to call a\\nspecial session\\nof one or both houses of Congress. Since\\nJohn Adams\\nfirst did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions.\\nHarry S. Truman\\nwas the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the\\nTurnip Day Session\\n. In addition, prior to ratification of the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\nin 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly\\ninaugurated\\npresidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nExecutive powers\\nMain article:\\nPowers of the president of the United States\\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

However, these nominations require\\nSenate confirmation\\nbefore they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to\\nU.S. district courts\\n, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of\\nsenatorial courtesy\\n. Presidents may also grant\\npardons\\nand\\nreprieves\\n.\\nGerald Ford\\npardoned\\nRichard Nixon\\na month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when\\nBill Clinton\\npardoned\\nPatty Hearst\\non his last day in office; this is often\\ncontroversial\\n.\\n[\\n98\\n]\\n[\\n99\\n]\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is\\nexecutive privilege\\n, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see\\nChief Justice\\nJohn Jay\\n's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain\\n. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nUnited States v. Nixon\\n, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the\\nLewinsky scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nClinton v. Jones\\n, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the\\nlegal precedent\\nthat executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nThe\\nstate secrets privilege\\nallows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from\\ndiscovery\\nin legal proceedings if such release would harm\\nnational security\\n. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when\\nThomas Jefferson\\nrefused to release military documents in the\\ntreason\\ntrial of\\nAaron Burr\\nand again in\\nTotten v. United States\\n, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHowever, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until\\nUnited States v. Reynolds\\n, where it was held to be a\\ncommon law\\nevidentiary\\nprivilege.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nBefore the\\nSeptember 11 attacks\\n, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nSince 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the\\nNinth Circuit\\n's ruling in\\nMohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nCritics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has\\nabsolute immunity\\nfrom court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions.\\nNixon v. Fitzgerald\\n(1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions.\\nClinton v. Jones\\n(1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019\\nMueller report\\non Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible\\nobstruction of justice\\n, but investigators declined to refer\\nDonald Trump\\nfor prosecution based on a\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\npolicy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy.

Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration\\npublic relations\\nofficials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\\"propagandized leadership\\\" which has a \\\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\\".\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nAdministration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops\\nof smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nOne critic wrote the image of John F.

With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party's voters.  Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The\\ncoattail effect\\n, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.  Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\nGlobal leader\\nWith the rise of the United States as a\\nsuperpower\\nin the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of\\nNATO\\n, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the\\nEuropean Union\\n, have led to the moniker that the president is the \\\"\\nleader of the free world\\n\\\".\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5\\nof the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\nbe a\\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\\n;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a\\nresident in the United States\\nfor at least 14 years.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 7\\n, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nUnder\\nSection 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment\\n, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nThere is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding\\nConfederates\\nfrom public office after the Civil War.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nUnder the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nPrior experience\\nMain articles:\\nList of presidents of the United States by other offices held\\n,\\nList of presidents of the United States by previous experience\\n, and\\nList of presidents of the United States by education\\nThere are no requirements for previous or concurrent offices held by the President or presidential candidates.

They typically vote for the candidates of the\\nparty\\nthat nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are\\npledged\\n.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nThe constitutionality of these laws was upheld in\\nChiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nFollowing the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an\\nabsolute majority\\nof electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the\\nHouse of Representatives\\nmust meet to elect a president using a\\ncontingent election\\nprocedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top\\nthree\\nelectoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\\u201373 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand fellow Democratic-Republican\\nAaron Burr\\nin the\\nelection of 1800\\nnecessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n3\\nof the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the\\nrunner-up\\nwould become vice president.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nOn February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president.

This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution:\\nI do solemnly swear (or\\naffirm\\n) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nPresidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a\\nBible\\nwhile taking the oath, and have added \\\"So help me God\\\" to the end of the oath.\\n[\\n151\\n]\\n[\\n152\\n]\\nAlthough the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the\\nchief justice of the United States\\n.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nIncumbency\\nTerm limit\\nPresident\\nWilliam McKinley\\nand his vice presidential running mate, New York Governor\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\n,\\nc.\\n1900\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nwon a record four\\npresidential elections\\nin\\n1932\\n,\\n1936\\n,\\n1940\\n, and\\n1944\\nprior to the implementation of the\\n22nd amendment\\nin 1951, which instituted a two-term limit.\\nWhen the first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\n, announced in his\\nFarewell Address\\nthat he was not running for a third term, he established a \\\"two terms then out\\\" precedent. Precedent became tradition after\\nThomas Jefferson\\npublicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors,\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nJames Monroe\\n.\\n[\\n153\\n]\\nIn spite of the strong two-term tradition,\\nUlysses S. Grant\\nsought nomination at the\\n1880 Republican National Convention\\nfor a non-consecutive third term, but was unsuccessful.\\n[\\n154\\n]\\nIn 1940, after leading the nation through the\\nGreat Depression\\nand focused on supporting U.S.\\nallied nations\\nat war with the\\nAxis powers\\n, Franklin Roosevelt was elected to a third term, breaking the long-standing precedent. Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in\\nWorld War II\\n, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nIn response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\nwas\\nadopted\\nin 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term.\\nHarry S. Truman\\n, the president at the time it was submitted to the states by the Congress, was exempted from its limitations. Without the exemption, he would not have been eligible to run for a second full term in 1952 (which he briefly sought), as he had served nearly all of Franklin Roosevelt's unexpired 1945\\u20131949 term and had been elected to a full four-year term beginning in 1949.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nVacancies and succession\\nUnder\\nSection\\n1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment\\n, ratified in 1967, the vice president becomes president upon the\\nremoval from office\\n, death, or resignation of the president. Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession),\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6\\n, stated only that the vice president assumes the \\\"powers and duties\\\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nUnder this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply\\nact\\nas president,\\n[\\n157\\n]\\npotentially resulting in a\\nspecial election\\n. Upon the death of President\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nin 1841, Vice President\\nJohn Tyler\\ndeclared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \\\"Acting President\\\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\\\".\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nThe\\nPresidential Succession Act\\nof 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C. \\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the\\npresidential line of succession\\nfollows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments\\nwho form the president's\\ncabinet\\n. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nDeclarations of inability\\nMain article:\\nTwenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes\\nacting president\\n, by transmitting to the\\nspeaker of the House\\nand the\\npresident\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate\\na statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by\\nRonald Reagan\\n(once),\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n(twice), and\\nJoe Biden\\n(once), each in anticipation of surgery.\\n[\\n159\\n]\\n[\\n160\\n]\\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment also provides that the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the\\nCabinet\\n, may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration, to the speaker of the House and the president\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate, to the effect that the president is unable to discharge his or her powers and duties. If the president then declares that no such inability exist, he or she resumes the presidential powers unless the vice president and Cabinet make a second declaration of presidential inability, in which case Congress decides the question.\\nRemoval\\nMain articles:\\nList of efforts to impeach presidents of the United States\\n,\\nFederal impeachment in the United States\\n, and\\nFederal impeachment trial in the United States\\nArticle II, Section 4\\nof the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \\\"\\ntreason\\n,\\nbribery\\n, or other\\nhigh crimes and misdemeanors\\n\\\".\\nArticle I, Section 2, Clause\\n5\\nauthorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a \\\"\\ngrand jury\\n\\\" with the power to impeach said officials by a majority vote.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause\\n6\\nauthorizes the Senate to serve as a\\ncourt\\nwith the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict.\\n[\\n162\\n]\\nThree presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in\\n1868\\n, Bill Clinton in\\n1998\\n, and Donald Trump in\\n2019\\nand\\n2021\\n; none have been convicted by the Senate. Additionally, the\\nHouse Judiciary Committee\\nconducted an impeachment inquiry against Richard Nixon in\\n1973\\u201374\\nand reported  three articles of impeachment to the House of Representatives for final action; however, he resigned from office before the House voted on them.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nCircumvention of authority\\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the part of the president, or with a long-term disability. In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders. This has ranged from\\nRichard Nixon\\n's Chief of Staff not transmitting orders to the Cabinet due to the president's heavy drinking, to staff removing memos from\\nDonald Trump\\n's desk.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nDecades before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a\\nstroke that left him partly incapacitated\\n.

In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the\\nBoeing C-32\\n, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet.

Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House:\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwas elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for 17 years, and\\nAndrew Johnson\\nreturned to the Senate in 1875, though he died soon after.

During his presidency, George W. Bush called on former presidents George H. W. Bush and Clinton to assist with humanitarian efforts after the\\n2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami\\n. President Obama followed suit by asking presidents Clinton and George W. Bush to lead efforts to aid Haiti after an\\nearthquake\\ndevastated that country in 2010.  Clinton's relationship with the two Bushes is not the first friendship between former presidents: Carter enjoyed a friendship and correspondence with\\nGerald Ford\\n, while Jefferson and\\nJohn Adams\\nhad an extended correspondence through letters in their post-presidencies.\\nClinton has been active politically since his presidential term ended\\n, working with his wife\\nHillary\\non her\\n2008\\nand\\n2016\\npresidential bids and President Obama on his\\n2012 reelection campaign\\n.

The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff.  The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by\\nimpeachment\\n.\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nAccording to a 2008 report by the\\nCongressional Research Service\\n:\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nChief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nFormer presidents who served in Congress may also collect\\ncongressional pensions\\n.\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nThe act also provides former presidents with travel funds and\\nfranking\\nprivileges.\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.\\n[\\n189\\n]\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nIn 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nOn January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him,\\nGeorge W.

Some even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document:\\nThe\\nHarry S.

In some cases (such as with Nixon), the presidential library is adjacent to one of the president's former homes, where in other cases, such as with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, the presidential library and the historic site are in different cities entirely.\\nPolitical affiliation\\nPolitical parties\\nhave dominated\\nAmerican politics\\nfor most of the nation's history. Though the\\nFounding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from\\npolitical factions\\n, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the\\nWashington administration\\nwere referred to as \\\"pro-administration\\\" and would eventually form the\\nFederalist Party\\n, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\n.\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained\\nunaffiliated\\nwith any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.\\n[\\n196\\n]\\n[\\n197\\n]\\nSince Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office, and, since 1869, every president has been a member of either the\\nRepublican\\nor\\nDemocratic\\nParties.\\n[\\n198\\n]\\n[\\n199\\n]\\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\\nParty\\nNumber of\\npresidents\\nName(s)\\nRepublican\\n19\\nChester\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Arthur\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0H.\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nCalvin\\u00a0Coolidge\\n,\\nDwight\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Eisenhower\\n,\\nGerald\\u00a0Ford\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Garfield\\n,\\nUlysses\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Grant\\n,\\nWarren\\u00a0G.\\u00a0Harding\\n,\\nBenjamin\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nRutherford\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Hayes\\n,\\nHerbert\\u00a0Hoover\\n,\\nAbraham\\u00a0Lincoln\\n,\\n[\\nG\\n]\\nWilliam\\u00a0McKinley\\n,\\nRichard\\u00a0Nixon\\n,\\nRonald\\u00a0Reagan\\n,\\nTheodore\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Howard\\u00a0Taft\\n, and\\nDonald\\u00a0Trump\\n(incumbent)\\nDemocratic\\n15\\nJoe Biden\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Buchanan\\n,\\nJimmy\\u00a0Carter\\n,\\nGrover\\u00a0Cleveland\\n,\\nBill\\u00a0Clinton\\n,\\nAndrew\\u00a0Jackson\\n,\\nLyndon\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Johnson\\n,\\nJohn\\u00a0F.\\u00a0Kennedy\\n,\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0Pierce\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0K.\\u00a0Polk\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nHarry\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Truman\\n,\\nMartin\\u00a0Van\\u00a0Buren\\n, and\\nWoodrow\\u00a0Wilson\\nDemocratic-Republican\\n4\\nJohn\\u00a0Quincy\\u00a0Adams\\n,\\nThomas\\u00a0Jefferson\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Madison\\n, and\\nJames\\u00a0Monroe\\nWhig\\n4\\nMillard\\u00a0Fillmore\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Henry\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nZachary\\u00a0Taylor\\n, and\\nJohn\\u00a0Tyler\\n[\\nH\\n]\\nFederalist\\n1\\nJohn\\u00a0Adams\\nNational Union\\n1\\nAndrew\\u00a0Johnson\\n[\\nI\\n]\\nIndependent\\n(No party)\\n1\\nGeorge\\u00a0Washington\\nTimeline of presidents\\nSee also:\\nList of presidents of the United States\\nThe following\\ntimeline\\ndepicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.\\nSee also\\nUnited States portal\\nPolitics portal\\nOutline of American politics\\nNotes\\n^\\nIn addition to $100,000 in travel reimbursement, $19,000 for entertainment and $50,000 for additional expenses.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\n^\\nThe informal term POTUS originated in the\\nPhillips Code\\n, a shorthand method created in 1879 by\\nWalter P.

The new government did not commence until the old government expired. It is apparent that the government did not commence on the Constitution's being ratified by the ninth state, for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognized by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members. It existed potentially until March 2, the day preceding that on which the members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\\\"\\nOwings v.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

The president directs the\\nexecutive branch\\nof the\\nfederal government\\nand is the\\ncommander-in-chief\\nof the\\nUnited States Armed Forces\\n.\\nThe power of the presidency has grown\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nsince the first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\n, took office in 1789.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nWhile presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasing role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with some expansions during the presidencies of\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nand\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining\\nsuperpower\\n.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nAs the leader of the nation with the\\nlargest economy by nominal GDP\\n, the president possesses significant domestic and international\\nhard\\nand\\nsoft power\\n. For much of the 20th century, especially during the\\nCold War\\n, the U.S. president was often called \\\"the leader of the free world\\\".\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nArticle II of the Constitution\\nestablishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's\\nmost expensive military\\n, which has the\\nsecond-largest nuclear arsenal\\n.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of\\nseparation of powers\\n,\\nArticle I, Section\\n7\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or\\nveto\\nfederal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is\\nelected indirectly\\nthrough the\\nElectoral College\\nto a four-year term, along with the\\nvice president\\n. Under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a\\npresident's intra-term death\\nor\\nresignation\\n.\\n[\\nC\\n]\\nIn all,\\n45 individuals\\nhave served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.\\n[\\nD\\n]\\nDonald Trump\\nis the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\nIn July 1776, the\\nThirteen Colonies\\n, represented at the\\nSecond Continental Congress\\nin\\nPhiladelphia\\n, unanimously adopted the\\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\\nin which the colonies declared themselves to be independent\\nsovereign states\\nand no longer under\\nBritish\\nrule.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe affirmation was made in the\\nDeclaration of Independence\\n, which was written predominantly by\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the\\nBritish\\n,\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nthe Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates\\ntogether. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nCongress finished work on the\\nArticles of Confederation\\nto establish a\\nperpetual union\\nbetween the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for\\nratification\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nUnder the Articles, which\\ntook effect\\non March 1, 1781, the\\nCongress of the Confederation\\nwas a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThis institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of\\nCrown\\nand\\nParliament\\nought to have functioned with respect to the royal\\ndominion\\n: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly\\nroyal prerogatives\\n(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a\\npresident of the United States in Congress Assembled\\nto preside over its deliberation as a neutral\\ndiscussion moderator\\n. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1783, the\\nTreaty of Paris\\nsecured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nBy 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their\\nhard currency\\npouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their\\nMediterranean\\ncommerce preyed upon by\\nNorth African\\npirates\\n, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nCivil and political unrest loomed.  Events such as the\\nNewburgh Conspiracy\\nand\\nShays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between\\nVirginia\\nand Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference\\nin 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in\\nAnnapolis, Maryland\\n, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms.

Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nPresident\\nLyndon B. Johnson\\nsigns the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act\\nat the\\nWhite House\\non July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\nand others look on.\\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the\\nPresentment Clause\\n, which gives the president the power to veto any\\nbill\\npassed by\\nCongress\\n. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\nof both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.  The veto \\u2013 or threat of a veto \\u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\nSign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill\\nbecomes law\\n.\\nVeto\\nthe legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\n.\\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto\\n.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the\\nLine Item Veto Act\\n. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In\\nClinton v. City of New York\\n,\\n524\\nU.S.\\n417\\n(1998), the\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nSetting the agenda\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump\\ndelivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore\\nCongress\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \\\"necessary and expedient\\\". This is done through the constitutionally-based\\nState of the Union\\naddress, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nPresidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of\\nagencies\\nthat can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\\"virtual army of 'czars'\\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\\".\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nPresidents have been criticized for making\\nsigning statements\\nwhen signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nThis practice has been criticized by the\\nAmerican Bar Association\\nas unconstitutional.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nConservative commentator\\nGeorge Will\\nwrote of an \\\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\\" and \\\"the eclipse of Congress\\\".\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by\\nArticle II, Section\\n3\\nof the Constitution to call a\\nspecial session\\nof one or both houses of Congress. Since\\nJohn Adams\\nfirst did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions.\\nHarry S. Truman\\nwas the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the\\nTurnip Day Session\\n. In addition, prior to ratification of the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\nin 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly\\ninaugurated\\npresidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nExecutive powers\\nMain article:\\nPowers of the president of the United States\\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

However, these nominations require\\nSenate confirmation\\nbefore they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to\\nU.S. district courts\\n, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of\\nsenatorial courtesy\\n. Presidents may also grant\\npardons\\nand\\nreprieves\\n.\\nGerald Ford\\npardoned\\nRichard Nixon\\na month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when\\nBill Clinton\\npardoned\\nPatty Hearst\\non his last day in office; this is often\\ncontroversial\\n.\\n[\\n98\\n]\\n[\\n99\\n]\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is\\nexecutive privilege\\n, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see\\nChief Justice\\nJohn Jay\\n's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain\\n. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nUnited States v. Nixon\\n, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the\\nLewinsky scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nClinton v. Jones\\n, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the\\nlegal precedent\\nthat executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nThe\\nstate secrets privilege\\nallows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from\\ndiscovery\\nin legal proceedings if such release would harm\\nnational security\\n. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when\\nThomas Jefferson\\nrefused to release military documents in the\\ntreason\\ntrial of\\nAaron Burr\\nand again in\\nTotten v. United States\\n, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHowever, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until\\nUnited States v. Reynolds\\n, where it was held to be a\\ncommon law\\nevidentiary\\nprivilege.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nBefore the\\nSeptember 11 attacks\\n, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nSince 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the\\nNinth Circuit\\n's ruling in\\nMohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nCritics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has\\nabsolute immunity\\nfrom court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions.\\nNixon v. Fitzgerald\\n(1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions.\\nClinton v. Jones\\n(1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019\\nMueller report\\non Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible\\nobstruction of justice\\n, but investigators declined to refer\\nDonald Trump\\nfor prosecution based on a\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\npolicy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy.

Hayes\\nbegan in 1878 the first White House\\negg rolling\\nfor local children.\\n[\\n117\\n]\\nBeginning in 1947, during the\\nHarry S. Truman\\nadministration, every\\nThanksgiving\\nthe president is presented with a live domestic turkey during the annual\\nNational Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation\\nheld at the White House. Since 1989, when the custom of \\\"pardoning\\\" the turkey was formalized by\\nGeorge H. W. Bush\\n, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.\\n[\\n118\\n]\\nPresidential traditions also involve the president's role as head of government. Many outgoing presidents since\\nJames Buchanan\\ntraditionally give advice to their successor during the\\npresidential transition\\n.\\n[\\n119\\n]\\nRonald Reagan\\nand his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on\\nInauguration Day\\nfor the incoming president.\\n[\\n120\\n]\\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration\\npublic relations\\nofficials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\\"propagandized leadership\\\" which has a \\\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\\".\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nAdministration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops\\nof smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nOne critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \\\"in rich detail\\\" which \\\"drew on the power of myth\\\" regarding the incident of\\nPT 109\\n[\\n123\\n]\\nand wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.\\n[\\n124\\n]\\nAs a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \\\"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\\\".\\n[\\n125\\n]\\nHead of party\\nThe president is typically considered to be the\\nde facto\\nhead and spokesperson of their political party.  With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party's voters.  Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The\\ncoattail effect\\n, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.  Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\nGlobal leader\\nWith the rise of the United States as a\\nsuperpower\\nin the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of\\nNATO\\n, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the\\nEuropean Union\\n, have led to the moniker that the president is the \\\"\\nleader of the free world\\n\\\".\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5\\nof the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\nbe a\\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\\n;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a\\nresident in the United States\\nfor at least 14 years.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 7\\n, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nUnder\\nSection 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment\\n, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nThere is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding\\nConfederates\\nfrom public office after the Civil War.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nUnder the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nPrior experience\\nMain articles:\\nList of presidents of the United States by other offices held\\n,\\nList of presidents of the United States by previous experience\\n, and\\nList of presidents of the United States by education\\nThere are no requirements for previous or concurrent offices held by the President or presidential candidates.  However, every President except Donald Trump has been a\\ngovernor\\n,\\nU.S. senator\\nor\\nCongressman\\n,\\ngeneral\\nor\\ncabinet member\\n.\\nThe most common previous profession of presidents is lawyer, applying to 27 of the 45 men who have served as President.\\n[\\n133\\n]\\nHowever, several future Presidents abandoned the study or practice of law prior to the Presidency.  There has never been a property qualification for the Presidency or other federal offices, but, in the early years of the republic, there were\\nproperty qualifications for voting\\nor for some of the stepping-stone offices to the Presidency (particularly governorships).  Prior to the Civil War, it was common for presidents to be men of significant property: Presidents from the North tended to own small farms, while several Southern presidents owned plantations and\\nslaves\\n.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n[\\n135\\n]\\nWhile several later presidents came from abject poverty, others, such as the Roosevelts, John Kennedy, and Donald Trump, were parties to extensive family fortunes.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n33 of the 45 men who served as President, including every president since 1953 and all but one since 1901, have had a bachelor's degree.

Typically, the party's presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee, and this choice is\\nrubber-stamped\\nby the convention.\\nNominees participate in\\nnationally televised debates\\n, and while the debates are usually restricted to the\\nDemocratic\\nand\\nRepublican\\nnominees,\\nthird party\\ncandidates may be invited, such as\\nRoss Perot\\nin the 1992 debates.

As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the\\nTwenty-third Amendment\\nprovides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.\\n[\\n136\\n]\\nCurrently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nIn all but two states, the party whose presidential\\u2013vice presidential\\nticket\\nreceives a\\nplurality\\nof popular votes in the state has its entire\\nslate\\nof elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nMaine\\nand\\nNebraska\\ndeviate from this\\nwinner-take-all\\npractice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each\\ncongressional district\\n.\\n[\\n139\\n]\\n[\\n140\\n]\\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the\\nparty\\nthat nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are\\npledged\\n.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nThe constitutionality of these laws was upheld in\\nChiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nFollowing the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an\\nabsolute majority\\nof electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the\\nHouse of Representatives\\nmust meet to elect a president using a\\ncontingent election\\nprocedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top\\nthree\\nelectoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\\u201373 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand fellow Democratic-Republican\\nAaron Burr\\nin the\\nelection of 1800\\nnecessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n3\\nof the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the\\nrunner-up\\nwould become vice president.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nOn February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the\\nTwelfth Amendment\\nin time to be used in the\\n1804 election\\n.\\n[\\n145\\n]\\nA quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the\\nelection of 1824\\n. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients:\\nAndrew Jackson\\n,\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\n, and\\nWilliam H. Crawford\\n. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.\\n[\\n146\\n]\\nInauguration\\nMain article:\\nUnited States presidential inauguration\\nPursuant to the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\n, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election.\\n[\\n147\\n]\\nThe first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as\\nInauguration Day\\n, were the\\nsecond terms\\nof President\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nand Vice President\\nJohn Nance Garner\\nin 1937.\\n[\\n148\\n]\\nPreviously, Inauguration Day was on March 4. As a result of the date change, the first term (1933\\u201337) of both men had been shortened by 43 days.\\n[\\n149\\n]\\nBefore executing the powers of the office, a president is required to\\nrecite\\nthe\\npresidential Oath of Office\\n, found in\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n8 of the Constitution\\n. This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution:\\nI do solemnly swear (or\\naffirm\\n) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nPresidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a\\nBible\\nwhile taking the oath, and have added \\\"So help me God\\\" to the end of the oath.\\n[\\n151\\n]\\n[\\n152\\n]\\nAlthough the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the\\nchief justice of the United States\\n.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nIncumbency\\nTerm limit\\nPresident\\nWilliam McKinley\\nand his vice presidential running mate, New York Governor\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\n,\\nc.\\n1900\\nFranklin D.

Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in\\nWorld War II\\n, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nIn response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\nwas\\nadopted\\nin 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term.\\nHarry S. Truman\\n, the president at the time it was submitted to the states by the Congress, was exempted from its limitations. Without the exemption, he would not have been eligible to run for a second full term in 1952 (which he briefly sought), as he had served nearly all of Franklin Roosevelt's unexpired 1945\\u20131949 term and had been elected to a full four-year term beginning in 1949.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nVacancies and succession\\nUnder\\nSection\\n1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment\\n, ratified in 1967, the vice president becomes president upon the\\nremoval from office\\n, death, or resignation of the president. Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession),\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6\\n, stated only that the vice president assumes the \\\"powers and duties\\\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nUnder this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply\\nact\\nas president,\\n[\\n157\\n]\\npotentially resulting in a\\nspecial election\\n. Upon the death of President\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nin 1841, Vice President\\nJohn Tyler\\ndeclared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \\\"Acting President\\\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\\\".\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nThe\\nPresidential Succession Act\\nof 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C. \\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the\\npresidential line of succession\\nfollows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments\\nwho form the president's\\ncabinet\\n. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nDeclarations of inability\\nMain article:\\nTwenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes\\nacting president\\n, by transmitting to the\\nspeaker of the House\\nand the\\npresident\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate\\na statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by\\nRonald Reagan\\n(once),\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n(twice), and\\nJoe Biden\\n(once), each in anticipation of surgery.\\n[\\n159\\n]\\n[\\n160\\n]\\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment also provides that the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the\\nCabinet\\n, may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration, to the speaker of the House and the president\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate, to the effect that the president is unable to discharge his or her powers and duties. If the president then declares that no such inability exist, he or she resumes the presidential powers unless the vice president and Cabinet make a second declaration of presidential inability, in which case Congress decides the question.\\nRemoval\\nMain articles:\\nList of efforts to impeach presidents of the United States\\n,\\nFederal impeachment in the United States\\n, and\\nFederal impeachment trial in the United States\\nArticle II, Section 4\\nof the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \\\"\\ntreason\\n,\\nbribery\\n, or other\\nhigh crimes and misdemeanors\\n\\\".\\nArticle I, Section 2, Clause\\n5\\nauthorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a \\\"\\ngrand jury\\n\\\" with the power to impeach said officials by a majority vote.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause\\n6\\nauthorizes the Senate to serve as a\\ncourt\\nwith the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict.\\n[\\n162\\n]\\nThree presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in\\n1868\\n, Bill Clinton in\\n1998\\n, and Donald Trump in\\n2019\\nand\\n2021\\n; none have been convicted by the Senate. Additionally, the\\nHouse Judiciary Committee\\nconducted an impeachment inquiry against Richard Nixon in\\n1973\\u201374\\nand reported  three articles of impeachment to the House of Representatives for final action; however, he resigned from office before the House voted on them.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nCircumvention of authority\\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the part of the president, or with a long-term disability. In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders. This has ranged from\\nRichard Nixon\\n's Chief of Staff not transmitting orders to the Cabinet due to the president's heavy drinking, to staff removing memos from\\nDonald Trump\\n's desk.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nDecades before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a\\nstroke that left him partly incapacitated\\n.

Obama has also been active politically since his presidential term ended, having worked with his former vice president\\nJoe Biden\\non his\\n2020 election campaign\\nand Biden's vice president\\nKamala Harris\\non her\\n2024 election campaign\\nafter President Biden\\nwithdrew his bid for re-election\\n.\\nAfter losing his bid for the presidency in 2020, Trump remained politically active and was an outspoken critic of his successor and the Democratic Party. He also contended with four criminal cases. Trump announced his fourth bid to the presidency in 2022, ultimately becoming the nominee of his party for the third time and won a second presidential term in 2024.\\nGrover Cleveland\\nwas also elected to nonconsecutive terms; his reelection bid failed in\\n1888\\nbut succeeded in\\n1892\\n.\\nPension and other benefits\\nThe\\nFormer Presidents Act\\n(FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection; also provided is funding for a certain number of staff and for office expenses.  The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff.  The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by\\nimpeachment\\n.\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nAccording to a 2008 report by the\\nCongressional Research Service\\n:\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nChief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nFormer presidents who served in Congress may also collect\\ncongressional pensions\\n.\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nThe act also provides former presidents with travel funds and\\nfranking\\nprivileges.\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.\\n[\\n189\\n]\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nIn 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nOn January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him,\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n, and all subsequent presidents.\\n[\\n192\\n]\\nA\\nfirst spouse\\nwho remarries is no longer eligible for Secret Service protection.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nWriting\\nMain article:\\nList of autobiographies by presidents of the United States\\nSince the publication of\\nUlysses S. Grant\\n's\\nPersonal Memoirs\\nin 1885, most presidents, including every president who survived to the end of their term from Calvin Coolidge to Barack Obama, has written at least one autobiography.  These autobiographies serve two purposes: to ensure the First Family's financial security (Clinton made over $30 million dollars from writing two books\\n[\\n193\\n]\\n), but also to defend or rehabilitate presidential legacies.\\nPresidential libraries and historic sites\\nMain articles:\\nPresidential library system\\nand\\nList of residences of presidents of the United States\\nThe homes where U.S. presidents were born, lived or vacationed have frequently been preserved as\\nhouse museums\\nand listed as\\nNational Historic Sites\\nor on\\nU.S. National Register of Historic Places\\n.\\nFrom left to right: Presidents\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nGeorge W.

Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nDallas\\nin 2013\\nEvery president since\\nHerbert Hoover\\nhas created a\\nrepository\\nknown as a\\npresidential library\\nfor preserving and making available his papers, records, and other documents and materials. Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the\\nNational Archives and Records Administration\\n(NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.\\n[\\n194\\n]\\nThere are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, including:\\nThe\\nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the State of\\nIllinois\\n;\\nThe\\nGeorge W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by\\nSouthern Methodist University\\n;\\nThe\\nGeorge H. W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by\\nTexas A&M University\\n; and\\nThe\\nLyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the\\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\\n.\\nSeveral former presidents have overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document:\\nThe\\nHarry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nIndependence, Missouri\\n;\\nThe\\nDwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home\\nin\\nAbilene, Kansas\\n;\\nThe\\nRichard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nYorba Linda, California\\n; and\\nThe\\nRonald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nSimi Valley, California\\n.\\nThese gravesites are open to the general public.  In some cases (such as with Nixon), the presidential library is adjacent to one of the president's former homes, where in other cases, such as with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, the presidential library and the historic site are in different cities entirely.\\nPolitical affiliation\\nPolitical parties\\nhave dominated\\nAmerican politics\\nfor most of the nation's history. Though the\\nFounding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from\\npolitical factions\\n, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the\\nWashington administration\\nwere referred to as \\\"pro-administration\\\" and would eventually form the\\nFederalist Party\\n, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\n.\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained\\nunaffiliated\\nwith any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.\\n[\\n196\\n]\\n[\\n197\\n]\\nSince Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office, and, since 1869, every president has been a member of either the\\nRepublican\\nor\\nDemocratic\\nParties.\\n[\\n198\\n]\\n[\\n199\\n]\\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\\nParty\\nNumber of\\npresidents\\nName(s)\\nRepublican\\n19\\nChester\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Arthur\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0H.\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nCalvin\\u00a0Coolidge\\n,\\nDwight\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Eisenhower\\n,\\nGerald\\u00a0Ford\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Garfield\\n,\\nUlysses\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Grant\\n,\\nWarren\\u00a0G.\\u00a0Harding\\n,\\nBenjamin\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nRutherford\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Hayes\\n,\\nHerbert\\u00a0Hoover\\n,\\nAbraham\\u00a0Lincoln\\n,\\n[\\nG\\n]\\nWilliam\\u00a0McKinley\\n,\\nRichard\\u00a0Nixon\\n,\\nRonald\\u00a0Reagan\\n,\\nTheodore\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Howard\\u00a0Taft\\n, and\\nDonald\\u00a0Trump\\n(incumbent)\\nDemocratic\\n15\\nJoe Biden\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Buchanan\\n,\\nJimmy\\u00a0Carter\\n,\\nGrover\\u00a0Cleveland\\n,\\nBill\\u00a0Clinton\\n,\\nAndrew\\u00a0Jackson\\n,\\nLyndon\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Johnson\\n,\\nJohn\\u00a0F.\\u00a0Kennedy\\n,\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0Pierce\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0K.\\u00a0Polk\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nHarry\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Truman\\n,\\nMartin\\u00a0Van\\u00a0Buren\\n, and\\nWoodrow\\u00a0Wilson\\nDemocratic-Republican\\n4\\nJohn\\u00a0Quincy\\u00a0Adams\\n,\\nThomas\\u00a0Jefferson\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Madison\\n, and\\nJames\\u00a0Monroe\\nWhig\\n4\\nMillard\\u00a0Fillmore\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Henry\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nZachary\\u00a0Taylor\\n, and\\nJohn\\u00a0Tyler\\n[\\nH\\n]\\nFederalist\\n1\\nJohn\\u00a0Adams\\nNational Union\\n1\\nAndrew\\u00a0Johnson\\n[\\nI\\n]\\nIndependent\\n(No party)\\n1\\nGeorge\\u00a0Washington\\nTimeline of presidents\\nSee also:\\nList of presidents of the United States\\nThe following\\ntimeline\\ndepicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.\\nSee also\\nUnited States portal\\nPolitics portal\\nOutline of American politics\\nNotes\\n^\\nIn addition to $100,000 in travel reimbursement, $19,000 for entertainment and $50,000 for additional expenses.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\n^\\nThe informal term POTUS originated in the\\nPhillips Code\\n, a shorthand method created in 1879 by\\nWalter P.

Later, while president, Johnson tried and failed to build a party of loyalists under the National Union banner.

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 contains only vague consultation requirements. Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act. Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and unconstitutional, and no president in the past 35 years has filed a report \\\"pursuant\\\" to these triggering provisions.\\n^\\na\\nb\\nc\\nd\\n\\\"The Law: The President's War Powers\\\"\\n.\\nTime\\n.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

The new government did not commence until the old government expired.

In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members.

Roosevelt\\nand\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining\\nsuperpower\\n.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nAs the leader of the nation with the\\nlargest economy by nominal GDP\\n, the president possesses significant domestic and international\\nhard\\nand\\nsoft power\\n. For much of the 20th century, especially during the\\nCold War\\n, the U.S. president was often called \\\"the leader of the free world\\\".\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nArticle II of the Constitution\\nestablishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's\\nmost expensive military\\n, which has the\\nsecond-largest nuclear arsenal\\n.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of\\nseparation of powers\\n,\\nArticle I, Section\\n7\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or\\nveto\\nfederal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is\\nelected indirectly\\nthrough the\\nElectoral College\\nto a four-year term, along with the\\nvice president\\n. Under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a\\npresident's intra-term death\\nor\\nresignation\\n.\\n[\\nC\\n]\\nIn all,\\n45 individuals\\nhave served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.\\n[\\nD\\n]\\nDonald Trump\\nis the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\nIn July 1776, the\\nThirteen Colonies\\n, represented at the\\nSecond Continental Congress\\nin\\nPhiladelphia\\n, unanimously adopted the\\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\\nin which the colonies declared themselves to be independent\\nsovereign states\\nand no longer under\\nBritish\\nrule.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe affirmation was made in the\\nDeclaration of Independence\\n, which was written predominantly by\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the\\nBritish\\n,\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nthe Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates\\ntogether. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nCongress finished work on the\\nArticles of Confederation\\nto establish a\\nperpetual union\\nbetween the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for\\nratification\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nUnder the Articles, which\\ntook effect\\non March 1, 1781, the\\nCongress of the Confederation\\nwas a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThis institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of\\nCrown\\nand\\nParliament\\nought to have functioned with respect to the royal\\ndominion\\n: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly\\nroyal prerogatives\\n(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a\\npresident of the United States in Congress Assembled\\nto preside over its deliberation as a neutral\\ndiscussion moderator\\n. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1783, the\\nTreaty of Paris\\nsecured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nBy 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their\\nhard currency\\npouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their\\nMediterranean\\ncommerce preyed upon by\\nNorth African\\npirates\\n, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nCivil and political unrest loomed.  Events such as the\\nNewburgh Conspiracy\\nand\\nShays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between\\nVirginia\\nand Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference\\nin 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in\\nAnnapolis, Maryland\\n, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the\\nconvention\\nfailed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states,\\nAlexander Hamilton\\nof New York led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in\\nPhiladelphia\\n. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nEdmund Randolph\\nsucceeded in securing\\nGeorge Washington\\n's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nWhen the\\nConstitutional Convention\\nconvened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (\\nRhode Island\\ndid not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nNew York\\noffered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIt was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the\\nU.S. Constitution\\nemerged.\\n1789\\u20131933\\nGeorge Washington\\n, the first president of the United States\\nAs the nation's first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\nestablished many norms that would come to define the office.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nHis decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the\\nTwenty-Second Amendment\\n. By the end of his presidency, political parties had developed,\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nwith\\nJohn Adams\\ndefeating\\nThomas Jefferson\\nin 1796, the first truly contested presidential election.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nAfter Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow Virginians\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nJames Monroe\\nwould each serve two terms, eventually dominating the nation's politics during the\\nEra of Good Feelings\\nuntil Adams' son\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwon election in 1824 after the\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\nsplit.\\nThe election of\\nAndrew Jackson\\nin 1828 was a significant milestone, as Jackson was not part of the Virginia and Massachusetts elite that had held the presidency for its first 40 years.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nJacksonian democracy\\nsought to strengthen the presidency at the expense of Congress, while broadening public participation as the nation rapidly expanded westward. However, his successor,\\nMartin Van Buren\\n, became unpopular after the\\nPanic of 1837\\n,\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nand the death of\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nand subsequent poor relations between\\nJohn Tyler\\nand Congress led to further weakening of the office.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nIncluding Van Buren, in the 24 years between 1837 and 1861, six presidential terms would be filled by eight different men, with none serving two terms.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nThe Senate played an important role during this period, with the\\nGreat Triumvirate\\nof\\nHenry Clay\\n,\\nDaniel Webster\\n, and\\nJohn C.

Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nPresident\\nLyndon B. Johnson\\nsigns the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act\\nat the\\nWhite House\\non July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\nand others look on.\\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the\\nPresentment Clause\\n, which gives the president the power to veto any\\nbill\\npassed by\\nCongress\\n. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\nof both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.  The veto \\u2013 or threat of a veto \\u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\nSign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill\\nbecomes law\\n.\\nVeto\\nthe legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\n.\\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto\\n.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the\\nLine Item Veto Act\\n. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In\\nClinton v. City of New York\\n,\\n524\\nU.S.\\n417\\n(1998), the\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nSetting the agenda\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump\\ndelivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore\\nCongress\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \\\"necessary and expedient\\\". This is done through the constitutionally-based\\nState of the Union\\naddress, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nPresidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of\\nagencies\\nthat can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\\"virtual army of 'czars'\\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\\".\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nPresidents have been criticized for making\\nsigning statements\\nwhen signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nThis practice has been criticized by the\\nAmerican Bar Association\\nas unconstitutional.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nConservative commentator\\nGeorge Will\\nwrote of an \\\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\\" and \\\"the eclipse of Congress\\\".\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by\\nArticle II, Section\\n3\\nof the Constitution to call a\\nspecial session\\nof one or both houses of Congress. Since\\nJohn Adams\\nfirst did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions.\\nHarry S. Truman\\nwas the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the\\nTurnip Day Session\\n. In addition, prior to ratification of the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\nin 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly\\ninaugurated\\npresidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nExecutive powers\\nMain article:\\nPowers of the president of the United States\\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

Generally, a president may remove executive officials at will.\\n[\\n80\\n]\\nHowever, Congress can curtail and constrain a president's authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by\\nstatute\\n.\\n[\\n81\\n]\\nTo manage the growing federal bureaucracy, presidents have gradually surrounded themselves with many layers of staff, who were eventually organized into the\\nExecutive Office of the President of the United States\\n. Within the Executive Office, the president's innermost layer of aides, and their assistants, are located in the\\nWhite House Office\\n.\\nThe president also possesses the power to manage operations of the federal government by issuing various\\ntypes of directives\\n, such as\\npresidential proclamation\\nand\\nexecutive orders\\n. When the president is lawfully exercising one of the constitutionally conferred presidential responsibilities, the scope of this power is broad.\\n[\\n82\\n]\\nEven so, these directives are subject to\\njudicial review\\nby U.S. federal courts, which can find them to be unconstitutional.

Such agreements, upon receiving the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate (by a\\ntwo-thirds majority\\nvote), become binding with the force of federal law.\\nWhile foreign affairs has always been a significant element of presidential responsibilities, advances in technology since the Constitution's adoption have increased presidential power.

However, these nominations require\\nSenate confirmation\\nbefore they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to\\nU.S. district courts\\n, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of\\nsenatorial courtesy\\n. Presidents may also grant\\npardons\\nand\\nreprieves\\n.\\nGerald Ford\\npardoned\\nRichard Nixon\\na month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when\\nBill Clinton\\npardoned\\nPatty Hearst\\non his last day in office; this is often\\ncontroversial\\n.\\n[\\n98\\n]\\n[\\n99\\n]\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is\\nexecutive privilege\\n, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see\\nChief Justice\\nJohn Jay\\n's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain\\n. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nUnited States v. Nixon\\n, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the\\nLewinsky scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nClinton v. Jones\\n, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the\\nlegal precedent\\nthat executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nThe\\nstate secrets privilege\\nallows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from\\ndiscovery\\nin legal proceedings if such release would harm\\nnational security\\n. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when\\nThomas Jefferson\\nrefused to release military documents in the\\ntreason\\ntrial of\\nAaron Burr\\nand again in\\nTotten v. United States\\n, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHowever, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until\\nUnited States v. Reynolds\\n, where it was held to be a\\ncommon law\\nevidentiary\\nprivilege.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nBefore the\\nSeptember 11 attacks\\n, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nSince 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the\\nNinth Circuit\\n's ruling in\\nMohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nCritics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has\\nabsolute immunity\\nfrom court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions.\\nNixon v. Fitzgerald\\n(1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions.\\nClinton v. Jones\\n(1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019\\nMueller report\\non Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible\\nobstruction of justice\\n, but investigators declined to refer\\nDonald Trump\\nfor prosecution based on a\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\npolicy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy. As of October 2019, a case was pending in the federal courts regarding access to personal tax returns in a criminal case brought against Donald Trump by the\\nNew York County District Attorney\\nalleging violations of New York state law.\\n[\\n109\\n]\\nMemoranda from the\\nOffice of Legal Counsel\\nissued in 1973 and 2000 internally prohibit the Department of Justice from prosecuting a president, which some legal scholars have criticized but others have endorsed.\\n[\\n110\\n]\\nIn defense against federal criminal prosecution for his\\nalleged 2020 election subversion\\n, in January 2024, Trump argued to the\\nDC Circuit Court of Appeals\\nthat a president enjoys absolute immunity for criminal acts conducted while in office. The next month, a three-judge panel of the court unanimously ruled against Trump. It was the first time an appeals court had addressed such a presidential immunity matter, since no other sitting or former president had ever been criminally indicted.\\n[\\n111\\n]\\nIn\\nTrump v. United States\\n, on July 1, 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents were entitled to absolute immunity from exercising core powers enumerated by the Constitution,\\npresumption\\nof immunity for other official acts, and no immunity for unofficial actions. The case was sent back to lower courts to determine which actions in the criminal complaint should be classified as official vs. unofficial.\\n[\\n112\\n]\\nThe ruling was the first time the courts granted a president criminal immunity.\\nLeadership roles\\nHead of state\\nFour ruffles and flourishes and 'Hail to the Chief' (long version)\\nProblems playing this file? See\\nmedia help\\n.\\nAs\\nhead of state\\n, the president represents the United States government to its own people and represents the nation to the rest of the world. For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a\\nState Arrival Ceremony\\nheld on the\\nSouth Lawn\\n, a custom begun by\\nJohn F. Kennedy\\nin 1961.\\n[\\n113\\n]\\nThis is followed by a\\nstate dinner\\ngiven by the president which is held in the\\nState Dining Room\\nlater in the evening.\\n[\\n114\\n]\\nPresident\\nWoodrow Wilson\\nthrows out the ceremonial first ball on\\nOpening Day\\nin 1916\\nPresident\\nBill Clinton\\nreviews honor guards at\\nBuckingham Palace\\nduring a 1995 state visit to the UK\\nAs a national leader, the president also fulfills many less formal ceremonial duties. For example,\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\nstarted the tradition of throwing out the\\nceremonial first pitch\\nin 1910 at\\nGriffith Stadium\\n, Washington, D.C., on the\\nWashington Senators's\\nOpening Day\\n.

Since 1989, when the custom of \\\"pardoning\\\" the turkey was formalized by\\nGeorge H. W. Bush\\n, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.\\n[\\n118\\n]\\nPresidential traditions also involve the president's role as head of government. Many outgoing presidents since\\nJames Buchanan\\ntraditionally give advice to their successor during the\\npresidential transition\\n.\\n[\\n119\\n]\\nRonald Reagan\\nand his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on\\nInauguration Day\\nfor the incoming president.\\n[\\n120\\n]\\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration\\npublic relations\\nofficials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\\"propagandized leadership\\\" which has a \\\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\\".\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nAdministration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops\\nof smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nOne critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \\\"in rich detail\\\" which \\\"drew on the power of myth\\\" regarding the incident of\\nPT 109\\n[\\n123\\n]\\nand wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.\\n[\\n124\\n]\\nAs a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \\\"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\\\".\\n[\\n125\\n]\\nHead of party\\nThe president is typically considered to be the\\nde facto\\nhead and spokesperson of their political party.  With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party's voters.  Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The\\ncoattail effect\\n, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.  Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\nGlobal leader\\nWith the rise of the United States as a\\nsuperpower\\nin the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of\\nNATO\\n, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the\\nEuropean Union\\n, have led to the moniker that the president is the \\\"\\nleader of the free world\\n\\\".\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5\\nof the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\nbe a\\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\\n;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a\\nresident in the United States\\nfor at least 14 years.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 7\\n, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nUnder\\nSection 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment\\n, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nThere is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding\\nConfederates\\nfrom public office after the Civil War.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nUnder the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nPrior experience\\nMain articles:\\nList of presidents of the United States by other offices held\\n,\\nList of presidents of the United States by previous experience\\n, and\\nList of presidents of the United States by education\\nThere are no requirements for previous or concurrent offices held by the President or presidential candidates.

There has never been a property qualification for the Presidency or other federal offices, but, in the early years of the republic, there were\\nproperty qualifications for voting\\nor for some of the stepping-stone offices to the Presidency (particularly governorships).  Prior to the Civil War, it was common for presidents to be men of significant property: Presidents from the North tended to own small farms, while several Southern presidents owned plantations and\\nslaves\\n.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n[\\n135\\n]\\nWhile several later presidents came from abject poverty, others, such as the Roosevelts, John Kennedy, and Donald Trump, were parties to extensive family fortunes.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n33 of the 45 men who served as President, including every president since 1953 and all but one since 1901, have had a bachelor's degree.

As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the\\nTwenty-third Amendment\\nprovides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.\\n[\\n136\\n]\\nCurrently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nIn all but two states, the party whose presidential\\u2013vice presidential\\nticket\\nreceives a\\nplurality\\nof popular votes in the state has its entire\\nslate\\nof elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nMaine\\nand\\nNebraska\\ndeviate from this\\nwinner-take-all\\npractice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each\\ncongressional district\\n.\\n[\\n139\\n]\\n[\\n140\\n]\\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the\\nparty\\nthat nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are\\npledged\\n.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nThe constitutionality of these laws was upheld in\\nChiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nFollowing the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an\\nabsolute majority\\nof electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the\\nHouse of Representatives\\nmust meet to elect a president using a\\ncontingent election\\nprocedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top\\nthree\\nelectoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\\u201373 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand fellow Democratic-Republican\\nAaron Burr\\nin the\\nelection of 1800\\nnecessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n3\\nof the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the\\nrunner-up\\nwould become vice president.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nOn February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the\\nTwelfth Amendment\\nin time to be used in the\\n1804 election\\n.\\n[\\n145\\n]\\nA quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the\\nelection of 1824\\n. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients:\\nAndrew Jackson\\n,\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\n, and\\nWilliam H. Crawford\\n. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.\\n[\\n146\\n]\\nInauguration\\nMain article:\\nUnited States presidential inauguration\\nPursuant to the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\n, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election.\\n[\\n147\\n]\\nThe first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as\\nInauguration Day\\n, were the\\nsecond terms\\nof President\\nFranklin D.

Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession),\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6\\n, stated only that the vice president assumes the \\\"powers and duties\\\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nUnder this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply\\nact\\nas president,\\n[\\n157\\n]\\npotentially resulting in a\\nspecial election\\n. Upon the death of President\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nin 1841, Vice President\\nJohn Tyler\\ndeclared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \\\"Acting President\\\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\\\".\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nThe\\nPresidential Succession Act\\nof 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C. \\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the\\npresidential line of succession\\nfollows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments\\nwho form the president's\\ncabinet\\n. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nDeclarations of inability\\nMain article:\\nTwenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes\\nacting president\\n, by transmitting to the\\nspeaker of the House\\nand the\\npresident\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate\\na statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by\\nRonald Reagan\\n(once),\\nGeorge W.

In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders.

In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the\\nBoeing C-32\\n, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet.

Prominent examples include\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\n's tenure as\\nchief justice of the United States\\nand\\nHerbert Hoover\\n's work on government reorganization after\\nWorld War II\\n. Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House:\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwas elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for 17 years, and\\nAndrew Johnson\\nreturned to the Senate in 1875, though he died soon after.

Bill Clinton also worked as an informal ambassador, most recently in the negotiations that led to the release of two American\\njournalists\\n,\\nLaura Ling\\nand\\nEuna Lee\\n, from\\nNorth Korea\\n. During his presidency, George W. Bush called on former presidents George H. W. Bush and Clinton to assist with humanitarian efforts after the\\n2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami\\n. President Obama followed suit by asking presidents Clinton and George W. Bush to lead efforts to aid Haiti after an\\nearthquake\\ndevastated that country in 2010.  Clinton's relationship with the two Bushes is not the first friendship between former presidents: Carter enjoyed a friendship and correspondence with\\nGerald Ford\\n, while Jefferson and\\nJohn Adams\\nhad an extended correspondence through letters in their post-presidencies.\\nClinton has been active politically since his presidential term ended\\n, working with his wife\\nHillary\\non her\\n2008\\nand\\n2016\\npresidential bids and President Obama on his\\n2012 reelection campaign\\n.

He also contended with four criminal cases. Trump announced his fourth bid to the presidency in 2022, ultimately becoming the nominee of his party for the third time and won a second presidential term in 2024.\\nGrover Cleveland\\nwas also elected to nonconsecutive terms; his reelection bid failed in\\n1888\\nbut succeeded in\\n1892\\n.\\nPension and other benefits\\nThe\\nFormer Presidents Act\\n(FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection; also provided is funding for a certain number of staff and for office expenses.  The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff.  The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by\\nimpeachment\\n.\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nAccording to a 2008 report by the\\nCongressional Research Service\\n:\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nChief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nFormer presidents who served in Congress may also collect\\ncongressional pensions\\n.\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nThe act also provides former presidents with travel funds and\\nfranking\\nprivileges.\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.\\n[\\n189\\n]\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nIn 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nOn January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him,\\nGeorge W.

Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the\\nNational Archives and Records Administration\\n(NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.\\n[\\n194\\n]\\nThere are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, including:\\nThe\\nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the State of\\nIllinois\\n;\\nThe\\nGeorge W.

Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by\\nTexas A&M University\\n; and\\nThe\\nLyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the\\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\\n.\\nSeveral former presidents have overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document:\\nThe\\nHarry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nIndependence, Missouri\\n;\\nThe\\nDwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home\\nin\\nAbilene, Kansas\\n;\\nThe\\nRichard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nYorba Linda, California\\n; and\\nThe\\nRonald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nSimi Valley, California\\n.\\nThese gravesites are open to the general public.  In some cases (such as with Nixon), the presidential library is adjacent to one of the president's former homes, where in other cases, such as with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, the presidential library and the historic site are in different cities entirely.\\nPolitical affiliation\\nPolitical parties\\nhave dominated\\nAmerican politics\\nfor most of the nation's history. Though the\\nFounding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from\\npolitical factions\\n, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the\\nWashington administration\\nwere referred to as \\\"pro-administration\\\" and would eventually form the\\nFederalist Party\\n, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\n.\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained\\nunaffiliated\\nwith any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.\\n[\\n196\\n]\\n[\\n197\\n]\\nSince Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office, and, since 1869, every president has been a member of either the\\nRepublican\\nor\\nDemocratic\\nParties.\\n[\\n198\\n]\\n[\\n199\\n]\\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\\nParty\\nNumber of\\npresidents\\nName(s)\\nRepublican\\n19\\nChester\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Arthur\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0H.\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nCalvin\\u00a0Coolidge\\n,\\nDwight\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Eisenhower\\n,\\nGerald\\u00a0Ford\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Garfield\\n,\\nUlysses\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Grant\\n,\\nWarren\\u00a0G.\\u00a0Harding\\n,\\nBenjamin\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nRutherford\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Hayes\\n,\\nHerbert\\u00a0Hoover\\n,\\nAbraham\\u00a0Lincoln\\n,\\n[\\nG\\n]\\nWilliam\\u00a0McKinley\\n,\\nRichard\\u00a0Nixon\\n,\\nRonald\\u00a0Reagan\\n,\\nTheodore\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Howard\\u00a0Taft\\n, and\\nDonald\\u00a0Trump\\n(incumbent)\\nDemocratic\\n15\\nJoe Biden\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Buchanan\\n,\\nJimmy\\u00a0Carter\\n,\\nGrover\\u00a0Cleveland\\n,\\nBill\\u00a0Clinton\\n,\\nAndrew\\u00a0Jackson\\n,\\nLyndon\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Johnson\\n,\\nJohn\\u00a0F.\\u00a0Kennedy\\n,\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0Pierce\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0K.\\u00a0Polk\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nHarry\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Truman\\n,\\nMartin\\u00a0Van\\u00a0Buren\\n, and\\nWoodrow\\u00a0Wilson\\nDemocratic-Republican\\n4\\nJohn\\u00a0Quincy\\u00a0Adams\\n,\\nThomas\\u00a0Jefferson\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Madison\\n, and\\nJames\\u00a0Monroe\\nWhig\\n4\\nMillard\\u00a0Fillmore\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Henry\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nZachary\\u00a0Taylor\\n, and\\nJohn\\u00a0Tyler\\n[\\nH\\n]\\nFederalist\\n1\\nJohn\\u00a0Adams\\nNational Union\\n1\\nAndrew\\u00a0Johnson\\n[\\nI\\n]\\nIndependent\\n(No party)\\n1\\nGeorge\\u00a0Washington\\nTimeline of presidents\\nSee also:\\nList of presidents of the United States\\nThe following\\ntimeline\\ndepicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.\\nSee also\\nUnited States portal\\nPolitics portal\\nOutline of American politics\\nNotes\\n^\\nIn addition to $100,000 in travel reimbursement, $19,000 for entertainment and $50,000 for additional expenses.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\n^\\nThe informal term POTUS originated in the\\nPhillips Code\\n, a shorthand method created in 1879 by\\nWalter P.

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 contains only vague consultation requirements. Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act. Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and unconstitutional, and no president in the past 35 years has filed a report \\\"pursuant\\\" to these triggering provisions.\\n^\\na\\nb\\nc\\nd\\n\\\"The Law: The President's War Powers\\\"\\n.\\nTime\\n.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

The new government did not commence until the old government expired. It is apparent that the government did not commence on the Constitution's being ratified by the ninth state, for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognized by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members. It existed potentially until March 2, the day preceding that on which the members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\\\"\\nOwings v.

The president directs the\\nexecutive branch\\nof the\\nfederal government\\nand is the\\ncommander-in-chief\\nof the\\nUnited States Armed Forces\\n.\\nThe power of the presidency has grown\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nsince the first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\n, took office in 1789.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nWhile presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasing role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with some expansions during the presidencies of\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nand\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining\\nsuperpower\\n.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nAs the leader of the nation with the\\nlargest economy by nominal GDP\\n, the president possesses significant domestic and international\\nhard\\nand\\nsoft power\\n. For much of the 20th century, especially during the\\nCold War\\n, the U.S. president was often called \\\"the leader of the free world\\\".\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nArticle II of the Constitution\\nestablishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's\\nmost expensive military\\n, which has the\\nsecond-largest nuclear arsenal\\n.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of\\nseparation of powers\\n,\\nArticle I, Section\\n7\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or\\nveto\\nfederal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is\\nelected indirectly\\nthrough the\\nElectoral College\\nto a four-year term, along with the\\nvice president\\n. Under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a\\npresident's intra-term death\\nor\\nresignation\\n.\\n[\\nC\\n]\\nIn all,\\n45 individuals\\nhave served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.\\n[\\nD\\n]\\nDonald Trump\\nis the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\nIn July 1776, the\\nThirteen Colonies\\n, represented at the\\nSecond Continental Congress\\nin\\nPhiladelphia\\n, unanimously adopted the\\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\\nin which the colonies declared themselves to be independent\\nsovereign states\\nand no longer under\\nBritish\\nrule.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe affirmation was made in the\\nDeclaration of Independence\\n, which was written predominantly by\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the\\nBritish\\n,\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nthe Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates\\ntogether. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nCongress finished work on the\\nArticles of Confederation\\nto establish a\\nperpetual union\\nbetween the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for\\nratification\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nUnder the Articles, which\\ntook effect\\non March 1, 1781, the\\nCongress of the Confederation\\nwas a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThis institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of\\nCrown\\nand\\nParliament\\nought to have functioned with respect to the royal\\ndominion\\n: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly\\nroyal prerogatives\\n(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a\\npresident of the United States in Congress Assembled\\nto preside over its deliberation as a neutral\\ndiscussion moderator\\n. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1783, the\\nTreaty of Paris\\nsecured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nBy 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their\\nhard currency\\npouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their\\nMediterranean\\ncommerce preyed upon by\\nNorth African\\npirates\\n, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nCivil and political unrest loomed.  Events such as the\\nNewburgh Conspiracy\\nand\\nShays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between\\nVirginia\\nand Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference\\nin 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in\\nAnnapolis, Maryland\\n, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the\\nconvention\\nfailed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states,\\nAlexander Hamilton\\nof New York led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in\\nPhiladelphia\\n. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nEdmund Randolph\\nsucceeded in securing\\nGeorge Washington\\n's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nWhen the\\nConstitutional Convention\\nconvened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (\\nRhode Island\\ndid not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nNew York\\noffered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIt was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the\\nU.S. Constitution\\nemerged.\\n1789\\u20131933\\nGeorge Washington\\n, the first president of the United States\\nAs the nation's first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\nestablished many norms that would come to define the office.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nHis decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the\\nTwenty-Second Amendment\\n. By the end of his presidency, political parties had developed,\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nwith\\nJohn Adams\\ndefeating\\nThomas Jefferson\\nin 1796, the first truly contested presidential election.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nAfter Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow Virginians\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nJames Monroe\\nwould each serve two terms, eventually dominating the nation's politics during the\\nEra of Good Feelings\\nuntil Adams' son\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwon election in 1824 after the\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\nsplit.\\nThe election of\\nAndrew Jackson\\nin 1828 was a significant milestone, as Jackson was not part of the Virginia and Massachusetts elite that had held the presidency for its first 40 years.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nJacksonian democracy\\nsought to strengthen the presidency at the expense of Congress, while broadening public participation as the nation rapidly expanded westward. However, his successor,\\nMartin Van Buren\\n, became unpopular after the\\nPanic of 1837\\n,\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nand the death of\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nand subsequent poor relations between\\nJohn Tyler\\nand Congress led to further weakening of the office.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nIncluding Van Buren, in the 24 years between 1837 and 1861, six presidential terms would be filled by eight different men, with none serving two terms.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nThe Senate played an important role during this period, with the\\nGreat Triumvirate\\nof\\nHenry Clay\\n,\\nDaniel Webster\\n, and\\nJohn C. Calhoun\\nplaying key roles in shaping national policy in the 1830s and 1840s until debates over slavery began pulling the nation apart in the 1850s.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nAbraham Lincoln\\n's leadership during the\\nCivil War\\nhas led historians to regard him as one of the nation's greatest presidents.\\n[\\nE\\n]\\nThe circumstances of the war and Republican domination of Congress made the office very powerful,\\n[\\n37\\n]\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nand Lincoln's re-election in 1864 was the first time a president had been re-elected since Jackson in 1832. After Lincoln's assassination, his successor\\nAndrew Johnson\\nlost all political support\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nand was nearly removed from office,\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nwith Congress remaining powerful during the two-term presidency of Civil War general\\nUlysses S. Grant\\n. After the end of\\nReconstruction\\n,\\nGrover Cleveland\\nwould eventually become the first Democratic president elected since before the war, running in three consecutive elections (1884, 1888, 1892) and winning twice. In 1900,\\nWilliam McKinley\\nbecame the first incumbent to win re-election since Grant in 1872.\\nAfter McKinley's\\nassassination\\nby\\nLeon Czolgosz\\nin 1901,\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\nbecame a dominant figure in American politics.\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nHistorians believe Roosevelt permanently changed the political system by strengthening the presidency,\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nwith some key accomplishments including breaking up trusts, conservationism, labor reforms, making personal character as important as the issues, and hand-picking his successor,\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\n. The following decade,\\nWoodrow Wilson\\nled the nation to victory during\\nWorld War I\\n, although Wilson's proposal for the\\nLeague of Nations\\nwas rejected by the Senate.\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nWarren Harding\\n, while popular in office, would see his legacy tarnished by scandals, especially\\nTeapot Dome\\n,\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nand\\nHerbert Hoover\\nquickly became very unpopular after failing to alleviate the\\nGreat Depression\\n.\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nImperial presidency\\nMain article:\\nImperial presidency\\nPresident\\nFranklin D.

Roosevelt\\nin 1933 led further toward what historians now describe as the\\nImperial presidency\\n.\\n[\\n46\\n]\\nBacked by enormous Democratic majorities in Congress and public support for major change, Roosevelt's\\nNew Deal\\ndramatically increased the size and scope of the federal government, including more executive agencies.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\n:\\u200a211\\u201312\\nThe traditionally small presidential staff was greatly expanded, with the\\nExecutive Office of the President\\nbeing created in 1939, none of whom require Senate confirmation.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\n:\\u200a229\\u2013231\\nRoosevelt's unprecedented re-election to a third and fourth term, the victory of the United States in\\nWorld War II\\n, and the nation's growing economy all helped established the office as a position of global leadership.\\n[\\n47\\n]\\n:\\u200a269\\nHis successors,\\nHarry Truman\\nand\\nDwight D.

Johnson\\nlost popular support due to the\\nVietnam War\\nand\\nRichard Nixon\\n's presidency collapsed in the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, Congress enacted a series of reforms intended to reassert itself.\\n[\\n50\\n]\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nThese included the\\nWar Powers Resolution\\n, enacted over Nixon's veto in 1973,\\n[\\n52\\n]\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nand the\\nCongressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974\\nthat sought to strengthen congressional fiscal powers.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nBy 1976,\\nGerald Ford\\nconceded that \\\"the historic pendulum\\\" had swung toward Congress, raising the possibility of a \\\"disruptive\\\" erosion of his ability to govern.\\n[\\n55\\n]\\nFord failed to win election to a full term and his successor,\\nJimmy Carter\\n, failed to win re-election.\\nRonald Reagan\\n, who had been an actor before beginning his political career, used his talent as a communicator to help reshape the American agenda away from New Deal policies toward more conservative ideology.\\n[\\n56\\n]\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nAfter the Cold War, the United States became the world's undisputed leading power.\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nBill Clinton\\n,\\nGeorge W.

Meanwhile, the nation gradually became more politically polarized, leading to the ascendency of increasingly polarized Congressmembers, especially following the\\n1994 mid-term elections\\nwhich saw Republicans control the House for the first time in 40 years, and the rise of routine\\nfilibusters\\nin the Senate.\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nRecent presidents have thus increasingly focused on\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to implement major policies, at the expense of legislation and congressional power.\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nPresidential elections in the 21st century have reflected this continuing polarization, with no candidate except Obama in 2008 winning by more than five percent of the popular vote and two, George W.

Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nPresident\\nLyndon B. Johnson\\nsigns the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act\\nat the\\nWhite House\\non July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\nand others look on.\\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the\\nPresentment Clause\\n, which gives the president the power to veto any\\nbill\\npassed by\\nCongress\\n. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\nof both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.  The veto \\u2013 or threat of a veto \\u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\nSign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill\\nbecomes law\\n.\\nVeto\\nthe legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\n.\\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto\\n.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the\\nLine Item Veto Act\\n. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In\\nClinton v. City of New York\\n,\\n524\\nU.S.\\n417\\n(1998), the\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nSetting the agenda\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump\\ndelivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore\\nCongress\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \\\"necessary and expedient\\\". This is done through the constitutionally-based\\nState of the Union\\naddress, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nPresidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of\\nagencies\\nthat can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\\"virtual army of 'czars'\\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\\".\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nPresidents have been criticized for making\\nsigning statements\\nwhen signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nThis practice has been criticized by the\\nAmerican Bar Association\\nas unconstitutional.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nConservative commentator\\nGeorge Will\\nwrote of an \\\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\\" and \\\"the eclipse of Congress\\\".\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by\\nArticle II, Section\\n3\\nof the Constitution to call a\\nspecial session\\nof one or both houses of Congress. Since\\nJohn Adams\\nfirst did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions.\\nHarry S. Truman\\nwas the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the\\nTurnip Day Session\\n. In addition, prior to ratification of the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\nin 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly\\ninaugurated\\npresidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nExecutive powers\\nMain article:\\nPowers of the president of the United States\\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

However, these nominations require\\nSenate confirmation\\nbefore they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to\\nU.S. district courts\\n, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of\\nsenatorial courtesy\\n. Presidents may also grant\\npardons\\nand\\nreprieves\\n.\\nGerald Ford\\npardoned\\nRichard Nixon\\na month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when\\nBill Clinton\\npardoned\\nPatty Hearst\\non his last day in office; this is often\\ncontroversial\\n.\\n[\\n98\\n]\\n[\\n99\\n]\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is\\nexecutive privilege\\n, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see\\nChief Justice\\nJohn Jay\\n's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain\\n. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nUnited States v. Nixon\\n, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the\\nLewinsky scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nClinton v. Jones\\n, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the\\nlegal precedent\\nthat executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nThe\\nstate secrets privilege\\nallows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from\\ndiscovery\\nin legal proceedings if such release would harm\\nnational security\\n. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when\\nThomas Jefferson\\nrefused to release military documents in the\\ntreason\\ntrial of\\nAaron Burr\\nand again in\\nTotten v. United States\\n, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHowever, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until\\nUnited States v. Reynolds\\n, where it was held to be a\\ncommon law\\nevidentiary\\nprivilege.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nBefore the\\nSeptember 11 attacks\\n, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nSince 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the\\nNinth Circuit\\n's ruling in\\nMohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nCritics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has\\nabsolute immunity\\nfrom court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions.\\nNixon v. Fitzgerald\\n(1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions.\\nClinton v. Jones\\n(1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019\\nMueller report\\non Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible\\nobstruction of justice\\n, but investigators declined to refer\\nDonald Trump\\nfor prosecution based on a\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\npolicy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy.

Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration\\npublic relations\\nofficials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\\"propagandized leadership\\\" which has a \\\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\\".\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nAdministration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops\\nof smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nOne critic wrote the image of John F.

With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party's voters.  Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The\\ncoattail effect\\n, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.  Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\nGlobal leader\\nWith the rise of the United States as a\\nsuperpower\\nin the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of\\nNATO\\n, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the\\nEuropean Union\\n, have led to the moniker that the president is the \\\"\\nleader of the free world\\n\\\".\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5\\nof the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\nbe a\\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\\n;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a\\nresident in the United States\\nfor at least 14 years.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 7\\n, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nUnder\\nSection 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment\\n, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nThere is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding\\nConfederates\\nfrom public office after the Civil War.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nUnder the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nPrior experience\\nMain articles:\\nList of presidents of the United States by other offices held\\n,\\nList of presidents of the United States by previous experience\\n, and\\nList of presidents of the United States by education\\nThere are no requirements for previous or concurrent offices held by the President or presidential candidates.

As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the\\nTwenty-third Amendment\\nprovides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.\\n[\\n136\\n]\\nCurrently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nIn all but two states, the party whose presidential\\u2013vice presidential\\nticket\\nreceives a\\nplurality\\nof popular votes in the state has its entire\\nslate\\nof elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nMaine\\nand\\nNebraska\\ndeviate from this\\nwinner-take-all\\npractice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each\\ncongressional district\\n.\\n[\\n139\\n]\\n[\\n140\\n]\\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the\\nparty\\nthat nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are\\npledged\\n.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nThe constitutionality of these laws was upheld in\\nChiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nFollowing the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an\\nabsolute majority\\nof electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the\\nHouse of Representatives\\nmust meet to elect a president using a\\ncontingent election\\nprocedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top\\nthree\\nelectoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\\u201373 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand fellow Democratic-Republican\\nAaron Burr\\nin the\\nelection of 1800\\nnecessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n3\\nof the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the\\nrunner-up\\nwould become vice president.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nOn February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the\\nTwelfth Amendment\\nin time to be used in the\\n1804 election\\n.\\n[\\n145\\n]\\nA quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the\\nelection of 1824\\n. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients:\\nAndrew Jackson\\n,\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\n, and\\nWilliam H. Crawford\\n. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.\\n[\\n146\\n]\\nInauguration\\nMain article:\\nUnited States presidential inauguration\\nPursuant to the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\n, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election.\\n[\\n147\\n]\\nThe first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as\\nInauguration Day\\n, were the\\nsecond terms\\nof President\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nand Vice President\\nJohn Nance Garner\\nin 1937.\\n[\\n148\\n]\\nPreviously, Inauguration Day was on March 4. As a result of the date change, the first term (1933\\u201337) of both men had been shortened by 43 days.\\n[\\n149\\n]\\nBefore executing the powers of the office, a president is required to\\nrecite\\nthe\\npresidential Oath of Office\\n, found in\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n8 of the Constitution\\n. This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution:\\nI do solemnly swear (or\\naffirm\\n) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nPresidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a\\nBible\\nwhile taking the oath, and have added \\\"So help me God\\\" to the end of the oath.\\n[\\n151\\n]\\n[\\n152\\n]\\nAlthough the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the\\nchief justice of the United States\\n.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nIncumbency\\nTerm limit\\nPresident\\nWilliam McKinley\\nand his vice presidential running mate, New York Governor\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\n,\\nc.\\n1900\\nFranklin D.

Precedent became tradition after\\nThomas Jefferson\\npublicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors,\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nJames Monroe\\n.\\n[\\n153\\n]\\nIn spite of the strong two-term tradition,\\nUlysses S. Grant\\nsought nomination at the\\n1880 Republican National Convention\\nfor a non-consecutive third term, but was unsuccessful.\\n[\\n154\\n]\\nIn 1940, after leading the nation through the\\nGreat Depression\\nand focused on supporting U.S.\\nallied nations\\nat war with the\\nAxis powers\\n, Franklin Roosevelt was elected to a third term, breaking the long-standing precedent. Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in\\nWorld War II\\n, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nIn response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\nwas\\nadopted\\nin 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term.\\nHarry S. Truman\\n, the president at the time it was submitted to the states by the Congress, was exempted from its limitations. Without the exemption, he would not have been eligible to run for a second full term in 1952 (which he briefly sought), as he had served nearly all of Franklin Roosevelt's unexpired 1945\\u20131949 term and had been elected to a full four-year term beginning in 1949.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nVacancies and succession\\nUnder\\nSection\\n1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment\\n, ratified in 1967, the vice president becomes president upon the\\nremoval from office\\n, death, or resignation of the president. Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession),\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6\\n, stated only that the vice president assumes the \\\"powers and duties\\\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nUnder this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply\\nact\\nas president,\\n[\\n157\\n]\\npotentially resulting in a\\nspecial election\\n. Upon the death of President\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nin 1841, Vice President\\nJohn Tyler\\ndeclared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \\\"Acting President\\\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\\\".\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nThe\\nPresidential Succession Act\\nof 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C. \\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the\\npresidential line of succession\\nfollows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments\\nwho form the president's\\ncabinet\\n. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nDeclarations of inability\\nMain article:\\nTwenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes\\nacting president\\n, by transmitting to the\\nspeaker of the House\\nand the\\npresident\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate\\na statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by\\nRonald Reagan\\n(once),\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n(twice), and\\nJoe Biden\\n(once), each in anticipation of surgery.\\n[\\n159\\n]\\n[\\n160\\n]\\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment also provides that the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the\\nCabinet\\n, may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration, to the speaker of the House and the president\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate, to the effect that the president is unable to discharge his or her powers and duties. If the president then declares that no such inability exist, he or she resumes the presidential powers unless the vice president and Cabinet make a second declaration of presidential inability, in which case Congress decides the question.\\nRemoval\\nMain articles:\\nList of efforts to impeach presidents of the United States\\n,\\nFederal impeachment in the United States\\n, and\\nFederal impeachment trial in the United States\\nArticle II, Section 4\\nof the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \\\"\\ntreason\\n,\\nbribery\\n, or other\\nhigh crimes and misdemeanors\\n\\\".\\nArticle I, Section 2, Clause\\n5\\nauthorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a \\\"\\ngrand jury\\n\\\" with the power to impeach said officials by a majority vote.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause\\n6\\nauthorizes the Senate to serve as a\\ncourt\\nwith the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict.\\n[\\n162\\n]\\nThree presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in\\n1868\\n, Bill Clinton in\\n1998\\n, and Donald Trump in\\n2019\\nand\\n2021\\n; none have been convicted by the Senate. Additionally, the\\nHouse Judiciary Committee\\nconducted an impeachment inquiry against Richard Nixon in\\n1973\\u201374\\nand reported  three articles of impeachment to the House of Representatives for final action; however, he resigned from office before the House voted on them.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nCircumvention of authority\\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the part of the president, or with a long-term disability. In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders. This has ranged from\\nRichard Nixon\\n's Chief of Staff not transmitting orders to the Cabinet due to the president's heavy drinking, to staff removing memos from\\nDonald Trump\\n's desk.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nDecades before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a\\nstroke that left him partly incapacitated\\n.

When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nFormer presidents who served in Congress may also collect\\ncongressional pensions\\n.\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nThe act also provides former presidents with travel funds and\\nfranking\\nprivileges.\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.\\n[\\n189\\n]\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nIn 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nOn January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him,\\nGeorge W.

In some cases (such as with Nixon), the presidential library is adjacent to one of the president's former homes, where in other cases, such as with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, the presidential library and the historic site are in different cities entirely.\\nPolitical affiliation\\nPolitical parties\\nhave dominated\\nAmerican politics\\nfor most of the nation's history. Though the\\nFounding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless.

Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and unconstitutional, and no president in the past 35 years has filed a report \\\"pursuant\\\" to these triggering provisions.\\n^\\na\\nb\\nc\\nd\\n\\\"The Law: The President's War Powers\\\"\\n.\\nTime\\n.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown. But the increase in reported cases is indicative of greater willingness to assert the privilege than in the past.\\n^\\nSavage, Charlie (September 8, 2010).\\n\\\"Court Dismisses a Case Asserting Torture by C.I.A.\\\"\\nThe New York Times\\n.

The new government did not commence until the old government expired. It is apparent that the government did not commence on the Constitution's being ratified by the ninth state, for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognized by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members. It existed potentially until March 2, the day preceding that on which the members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\\\"\\nOwings v.

The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's\\nmost expensive military\\n, which has the\\nsecond-largest nuclear arsenal\\n.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of\\nseparation of powers\\n,\\nArticle I, Section\\n7\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or\\nveto\\nfederal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is\\nelected indirectly\\nthrough the\\nElectoral College\\nto a four-year term, along with the\\nvice president\\n. Under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a\\npresident's intra-term death\\nor\\nresignation\\n.\\n[\\nC\\n]\\nIn all,\\n45 individuals\\nhave served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.\\n[\\nD\\n]\\nDonald Trump\\nis the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\nIn July 1776, the\\nThirteen Colonies\\n, represented at the\\nSecond Continental Congress\\nin\\nPhiladelphia\\n, unanimously adopted the\\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\\nin which the colonies declared themselves to be independent\\nsovereign states\\nand no longer under\\nBritish\\nrule.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe affirmation was made in the\\nDeclaration of Independence\\n, which was written predominantly by\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the\\nBritish\\n,\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nthe Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates\\ntogether. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nCongress finished work on the\\nArticles of Confederation\\nto establish a\\nperpetual union\\nbetween the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for\\nratification\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nUnder the Articles, which\\ntook effect\\non March 1, 1781, the\\nCongress of the Confederation\\nwas a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThis institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of\\nCrown\\nand\\nParliament\\nought to have functioned with respect to the royal\\ndominion\\n: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly\\nroyal prerogatives\\n(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a\\npresident of the United States in Congress Assembled\\nto preside over its deliberation as a neutral\\ndiscussion moderator\\n. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1783, the\\nTreaty of Paris\\nsecured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nBy 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their\\nhard currency\\npouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their\\nMediterranean\\ncommerce preyed upon by\\nNorth African\\npirates\\n, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nCivil and political unrest loomed.  Events such as the\\nNewburgh Conspiracy\\nand\\nShays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between\\nVirginia\\nand Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference\\nin 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in\\nAnnapolis, Maryland\\n, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the\\nconvention\\nfailed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states,\\nAlexander Hamilton\\nof New York led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in\\nPhiladelphia\\n.

Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nNew York\\noffered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIt was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the\\nU.S. Constitution\\nemerged.\\n1789\\u20131933\\nGeorge Washington\\n, the first president of the United States\\nAs the nation's first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\nestablished many norms that would come to define the office.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nHis decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the\\nTwenty-Second Amendment\\n.

Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nPresident\\nLyndon B. Johnson\\nsigns the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act\\nat the\\nWhite House\\non July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\nand others look on.\\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the\\nPresentment Clause\\n, which gives the president the power to veto any\\nbill\\npassed by\\nCongress\\n. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\nof both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.  The veto \\u2013 or threat of a veto \\u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\nSign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill\\nbecomes law\\n.\\nVeto\\nthe legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\n.\\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto\\n.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the\\nLine Item Veto Act\\n. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In\\nClinton v. City of New York\\n,\\n524\\nU.S.\\n417\\n(1998), the\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nSetting the agenda\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump\\ndelivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore\\nCongress\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \\\"necessary and expedient\\\". This is done through the constitutionally-based\\nState of the Union\\naddress, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nPresidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of\\nagencies\\nthat can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\\"virtual army of 'czars'\\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\\".\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nPresidents have been criticized for making\\nsigning statements\\nwhen signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nThis practice has been criticized by the\\nAmerican Bar Association\\nas unconstitutional.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nConservative commentator\\nGeorge Will\\nwrote of an \\\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\\" and \\\"the eclipse of Congress\\\".\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by\\nArticle II, Section\\n3\\nof the Constitution to call a\\nspecial session\\nof one or both houses of Congress. Since\\nJohn Adams\\nfirst did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions.\\nHarry S. Truman\\nwas the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the\\nTurnip Day Session\\n. In addition, prior to ratification of the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\nin 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly\\ninaugurated\\npresidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nExecutive powers\\nMain article:\\nPowers of the president of the United States\\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

When the president is lawfully exercising one of the constitutionally conferred presidential responsibilities, the scope of this power is broad.\\n[\\n82\\n]\\nEven so, these directives are subject to\\njudicial review\\nby U.S. federal courts, which can find them to be unconstitutional.

The first is\\nexecutive privilege\\n, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see\\nChief Justice\\nJohn Jay\\n's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain\\n. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nUnited States v. Nixon\\n, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the\\nLewinsky scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nClinton v. Jones\\n, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the\\nlegal precedent\\nthat executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nThe\\nstate secrets privilege\\nallows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from\\ndiscovery\\nin legal proceedings if such release would harm\\nnational security\\n. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when\\nThomas Jefferson\\nrefused to release military documents in the\\ntreason\\ntrial of\\nAaron Burr\\nand again in\\nTotten v. United States\\n, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHowever, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until\\nUnited States v. Reynolds\\n, where it was held to be a\\ncommon law\\nevidentiary\\nprivilege.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nBefore the\\nSeptember 11 attacks\\n, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nSince 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the\\nNinth Circuit\\n's ruling in\\nMohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nCritics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has\\nabsolute immunity\\nfrom court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions.\\nNixon v. Fitzgerald\\n(1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions.\\nClinton v. Jones\\n(1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019\\nMueller report\\non Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible\\nobstruction of justice\\n, but investigators declined to refer\\nDonald Trump\\nfor prosecution based on a\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\npolicy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy. As of October 2019, a case was pending in the federal courts regarding access to personal tax returns in a criminal case brought against Donald Trump by the\\nNew York County District Attorney\\nalleging violations of New York state law.\\n[\\n109\\n]\\nMemoranda from the\\nOffice of Legal Counsel\\nissued in 1973 and 2000 internally prohibit the Department of Justice from prosecuting a president, which some legal scholars have criticized but others have endorsed.\\n[\\n110\\n]\\nIn defense against federal criminal prosecution for his\\nalleged 2020 election subversion\\n, in January 2024, Trump argued to the\\nDC Circuit Court of Appeals\\nthat a president enjoys absolute immunity for criminal acts conducted while in office. The next month, a three-judge panel of the court unanimously ruled against Trump. It was the first time an appeals court had addressed such a presidential immunity matter, since no other sitting or former president had ever been criminally indicted.\\n[\\n111\\n]\\nIn\\nTrump v. United States\\n, on July 1, 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents were entitled to absolute immunity from exercising core powers enumerated by the Constitution,\\npresumption\\nof immunity for other official acts, and no immunity for unofficial actions. The case was sent back to lower courts to determine which actions in the criminal complaint should be classified as official vs. unofficial.\\n[\\n112\\n]\\nThe ruling was the first time the courts granted a president criminal immunity.\\nLeadership roles\\nHead of state\\nFour ruffles and flourishes and 'Hail to the Chief' (long version)\\nProblems playing this file? See\\nmedia help\\n.\\nAs\\nhead of state\\n, the president represents the United States government to its own people and represents the nation to the rest of the world. For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a\\nState Arrival Ceremony\\nheld on the\\nSouth Lawn\\n, a custom begun by\\nJohn F. Kennedy\\nin 1961.\\n[\\n113\\n]\\nThis is followed by a\\nstate dinner\\ngiven by the president which is held in the\\nState Dining Room\\nlater in the evening.\\n[\\n114\\n]\\nPresident\\nWoodrow Wilson\\nthrows out the ceremonial first ball on\\nOpening Day\\nin 1916\\nPresident\\nBill Clinton\\nreviews honor guards at\\nBuckingham Palace\\nduring a 1995 state visit to the UK\\nAs a national leader, the president also fulfills many less formal ceremonial duties. For example,\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\nstarted the tradition of throwing out the\\nceremonial first pitch\\nin 1910 at\\nGriffith Stadium\\n, Washington, D.C., on the\\nWashington Senators's\\nOpening Day\\n. Every president since Taft, except for\\nJimmy Carter\\n, threw out at least one ceremonial first ball or pitch for Opening Day, the\\nAll-Star Game\\n, or the\\nWorld Series\\n, usually with much fanfare.\\n[\\n115\\n]\\nEvery president since\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\nhas served as honorary president of the\\nBoy Scouts of America\\n.\\n[\\n116\\n]\\nOther presidential traditions are associated with American holidays.\\nRutherford B.

Since 1989, when the custom of \\\"pardoning\\\" the turkey was formalized by\\nGeorge H. W. Bush\\n, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.\\n[\\n118\\n]\\nPresidential traditions also involve the president's role as head of government. Many outgoing presidents since\\nJames Buchanan\\ntraditionally give advice to their successor during the\\npresidential transition\\n.\\n[\\n119\\n]\\nRonald Reagan\\nand his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on\\nInauguration Day\\nfor the incoming president.\\n[\\n120\\n]\\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration\\npublic relations\\nofficials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\\"propagandized leadership\\\" which has a \\\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\\".\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nAdministration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops\\nof smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nOne critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \\\"in rich detail\\\" which \\\"drew on the power of myth\\\" regarding the incident of\\nPT 109\\n[\\n123\\n]\\nand wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.\\n[\\n124\\n]\\nAs a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \\\"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\\\".\\n[\\n125\\n]\\nHead of party\\nThe president is typically considered to be the\\nde facto\\nhead and spokesperson of their political party.  With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party's voters.  Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The\\ncoattail effect\\n, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.  Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\nGlobal leader\\nWith the rise of the United States as a\\nsuperpower\\nin the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of\\nNATO\\n, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the\\nEuropean Union\\n, have led to the moniker that the president is the \\\"\\nleader of the free world\\n\\\".\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5\\nof the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\nbe a\\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\\n;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a\\nresident in the United States\\nfor at least 14 years.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 7\\n, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nUnder\\nSection 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment\\n, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nThere is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding\\nConfederates\\nfrom public office after the Civil War.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nUnder the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nPrior experience\\nMain articles:\\nList of presidents of the United States by other offices held\\n,\\nList of presidents of the United States by previous experience\\n, and\\nList of presidents of the United States by education\\nThere are no requirements for previous or concurrent offices held by the President or presidential candidates.

There has never been a property qualification for the Presidency or other federal offices, but, in the early years of the republic, there were\\nproperty qualifications for voting\\nor for some of the stepping-stone offices to the Presidency (particularly governorships).  Prior to the Civil War, it was common for presidents to be men of significant property: Presidents from the North tended to own small farms, while several Southern presidents owned plantations and\\nslaves\\n.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n[\\n135\\n]\\nWhile several later presidents came from abject poverty, others, such as the Roosevelts, John Kennedy, and Donald Trump, were parties to extensive family fortunes.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n33 of the 45 men who served as President, including every president since 1953 and all but one since 1901, have had a bachelor's degree.

As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the\\nTwenty-third Amendment\\nprovides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.\\n[\\n136\\n]\\nCurrently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nIn all but two states, the party whose presidential\\u2013vice presidential\\nticket\\nreceives a\\nplurality\\nof popular votes in the state has its entire\\nslate\\nof elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nMaine\\nand\\nNebraska\\ndeviate from this\\nwinner-take-all\\npractice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each\\ncongressional district\\n.\\n[\\n139\\n]\\n[\\n140\\n]\\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the\\nparty\\nthat nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are\\npledged\\n.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nThe constitutionality of these laws was upheld in\\nChiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nFollowing the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an\\nabsolute majority\\nof electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the\\nHouse of Representatives\\nmust meet to elect a president using a\\ncontingent election\\nprocedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top\\nthree\\nelectoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\\u201373 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand fellow Democratic-Republican\\nAaron Burr\\nin the\\nelection of 1800\\nnecessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n3\\nof the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the\\nrunner-up\\nwould become vice president.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nOn February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the\\nTwelfth Amendment\\nin time to be used in the\\n1804 election\\n.\\n[\\n145\\n]\\nA quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the\\nelection of 1824\\n. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients:\\nAndrew Jackson\\n,\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\n, and\\nWilliam H. Crawford\\n. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.\\n[\\n146\\n]\\nInauguration\\nMain article:\\nUnited States presidential inauguration\\nPursuant to the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\n, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election.\\n[\\n147\\n]\\nThe first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as\\nInauguration Day\\n, were the\\nsecond terms\\nof President\\nFranklin D.

Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession),\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6\\n, stated only that the vice president assumes the \\\"powers and duties\\\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nUnder this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply\\nact\\nas president,\\n[\\n157\\n]\\npotentially resulting in a\\nspecial election\\n. Upon the death of President\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nin 1841, Vice President\\nJohn Tyler\\ndeclared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \\\"Acting President\\\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\\\".\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nThe\\nPresidential Succession Act\\nof 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C. \\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the\\npresidential line of succession\\nfollows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments\\nwho form the president's\\ncabinet\\n. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nDeclarations of inability\\nMain article:\\nTwenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes\\nacting president\\n, by transmitting to the\\nspeaker of the House\\nand the\\npresident\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate\\na statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by\\nRonald Reagan\\n(once),\\nGeorge W.

In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the\\nBoeing C-32\\n, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet. Any civilian aircraft the president is aboard is designated\\nExecutive One\\nfor the flight.\\n[\\n172\\n]\\nFor short-distance air travel, the president has access to a fleet of\\nU.S. Marine Corps\\nhelicopters of varying models, designated\\nMarine One\\nwhen the president is aboard any particular one in the fleet.

Prominent examples include\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\n's tenure as\\nchief justice of the United States\\nand\\nHerbert Hoover\\n's work on government reorganization after\\nWorld War II\\n. Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House:\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwas elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for 17 years, and\\nAndrew Johnson\\nreturned to the Senate in 1875, though he died soon after. Some ex-presidents were very active, especially in international affairs, most notably Theodore Roosevelt;\\n[\\n178\\n]\\nHerbert Hoover;\\n[\\n179\\n]\\nRichard Nixon;\\n[\\n180\\n]\\nand Jimmy Carter.\\n[\\n181\\n]\\n[\\n182\\n]\\nEarlier presidents returned to their hometowns to lead charitable work there, or supervised farm work on their farms or plantations, many of which had been neglected during their presidencies.\\nThomas Jefferson\\nfounded the\\nUniversity of Virginia\\nduring his post-presidency, and, following his death, was succeeded as rector by\\nJames Madison\\n.  Madison and\\nJames Monroe\\nparticipated in the drafting of one version of the\\nVirginia Constitution\\n, while\\nJohn Tyler\\nserved at the Confederate Constitution and in the Confederate Congress.\\nPresidents may use their predecessors as emissaries to deliver private messages to other nations or as official representatives of the United States to state funerals and other important foreign events.\\n[\\n183\\n]\\n[\\n184\\n]\\nRichard Nixon made multiple foreign trips to countries including China and Russia and was lauded as an elder statesman.\\n[\\n185\\n]\\nDuring his post-presidency\\n,\\nJimmy Carter\\nbecame a global\\nhuman rights\\ncampaigner, international arbiter, and election monitor, as well as a recipient of the\\nNobel Peace Prize\\n. Bill Clinton also worked as an informal ambassador, most recently in the negotiations that led to the release of two American\\njournalists\\n,\\nLaura Ling\\nand\\nEuna Lee\\n, from\\nNorth Korea\\n. During his presidency, George W. Bush called on former presidents George H. W. Bush and Clinton to assist with humanitarian efforts after the\\n2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami\\n. President Obama followed suit by asking presidents Clinton and George W. Bush to lead efforts to aid Haiti after an\\nearthquake\\ndevastated that country in 2010.  Clinton's relationship with the two Bushes is not the first friendship between former presidents: Carter enjoyed a friendship and correspondence with\\nGerald Ford\\n, while Jefferson and\\nJohn Adams\\nhad an extended correspondence through letters in their post-presidencies.\\nClinton has been active politically since his presidential term ended\\n, working with his wife\\nHillary\\non her\\n2008\\nand\\n2016\\npresidential bids and President Obama on his\\n2012 reelection campaign\\n. Obama has also been active politically since his presidential term ended, having worked with his former vice president\\nJoe Biden\\non his\\n2020 election campaign\\nand Biden's vice president\\nKamala Harris\\non her\\n2024 election campaign\\nafter President Biden\\nwithdrew his bid for re-election\\n.\\nAfter losing his bid for the presidency in 2020, Trump remained politically active and was an outspoken critic of his successor and the Democratic Party. He also contended with four criminal cases. Trump announced his fourth bid to the presidency in 2022, ultimately becoming the nominee of his party for the third time and won a second presidential term in 2024.\\nGrover Cleveland\\nwas also elected to nonconsecutive terms; his reelection bid failed in\\n1888\\nbut succeeded in\\n1892\\n.\\nPension and other benefits\\nThe\\nFormer Presidents Act\\n(FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection; also provided is funding for a certain number of staff and for office expenses.  The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff.  The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by\\nimpeachment\\n.\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nAccording to a 2008 report by the\\nCongressional Research Service\\n:\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nChief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nFormer presidents who served in Congress may also collect\\ncongressional pensions\\n.\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nThe act also provides former presidents with travel funds and\\nfranking\\nprivileges.\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.\\n[\\n189\\n]\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nIn 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nOn January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him,\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n, and all subsequent presidents.\\n[\\n192\\n]\\nA\\nfirst spouse\\nwho remarries is no longer eligible for Secret Service protection.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nWriting\\nMain article:\\nList of autobiographies by presidents of the United States\\nSince the publication of\\nUlysses S. Grant\\n's\\nPersonal Memoirs\\nin 1885, most presidents, including every president who survived to the end of their term from Calvin Coolidge to Barack Obama, has written at least one autobiography.  These autobiographies serve two purposes: to ensure the First Family's financial security (Clinton made over $30 million dollars from writing two books\\n[\\n193\\n]\\n), but also to defend or rehabilitate presidential legacies.\\nPresidential libraries and historic sites\\nMain articles:\\nPresidential library system\\nand\\nList of residences of presidents of the United States\\nThe homes where U.S. presidents were born, lived or vacationed have frequently been preserved as\\nhouse museums\\nand listed as\\nNational Historic Sites\\nor on\\nU.S. National Register of Historic Places\\n.\\nFrom left to right: Presidents\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nGeorge W.

Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the\\nNational Archives and Records Administration\\n(NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.\\n[\\n194\\n]\\nThere are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, including:\\nThe\\nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the State of\\nIllinois\\n;\\nThe\\nGeorge W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by\\nSouthern Methodist University\\n;\\nThe\\nGeorge H. W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by\\nTexas A&M University\\n; and\\nThe\\nLyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the\\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\\n.\\nSeveral former presidents have overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document:\\nThe\\nHarry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nIndependence, Missouri\\n;\\nThe\\nDwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home\\nin\\nAbilene, Kansas\\n;\\nThe\\nRichard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nYorba Linda, California\\n; and\\nThe\\nRonald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nSimi Valley, California\\n.\\nThese gravesites are open to the general public.  In some cases (such as with Nixon), the presidential library is adjacent to one of the president's former homes, where in other cases, such as with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, the presidential library and the historic site are in different cities entirely.\\nPolitical affiliation\\nPolitical parties\\nhave dominated\\nAmerican politics\\nfor most of the nation's history. Though the\\nFounding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from\\npolitical factions\\n, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the\\nWashington administration\\nwere referred to as \\\"pro-administration\\\" and would eventually form the\\nFederalist Party\\n, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\n.\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained\\nunaffiliated\\nwith any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.\\n[\\n196\\n]\\n[\\n197\\n]\\nSince Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office, and, since 1869, every president has been a member of either the\\nRepublican\\nor\\nDemocratic\\nParties.\\n[\\n198\\n]\\n[\\n199\\n]\\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\\nParty\\nNumber of\\npresidents\\nName(s)\\nRepublican\\n19\\nChester\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Arthur\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0H.\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nCalvin\\u00a0Coolidge\\n,\\nDwight\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Eisenhower\\n,\\nGerald\\u00a0Ford\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Garfield\\n,\\nUlysses\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Grant\\n,\\nWarren\\u00a0G.\\u00a0Harding\\n,\\nBenjamin\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nRutherford\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Hayes\\n,\\nHerbert\\u00a0Hoover\\n,\\nAbraham\\u00a0Lincoln\\n,\\n[\\nG\\n]\\nWilliam\\u00a0McKinley\\n,\\nRichard\\u00a0Nixon\\n,\\nRonald\\u00a0Reagan\\n,\\nTheodore\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Howard\\u00a0Taft\\n, and\\nDonald\\u00a0Trump\\n(incumbent)\\nDemocratic\\n15\\nJoe Biden\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Buchanan\\n,\\nJimmy\\u00a0Carter\\n,\\nGrover\\u00a0Cleveland\\n,\\nBill\\u00a0Clinton\\n,\\nAndrew\\u00a0Jackson\\n,\\nLyndon\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Johnson\\n,\\nJohn\\u00a0F.\\u00a0Kennedy\\n,\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0Pierce\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0K.\\u00a0Polk\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nHarry\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Truman\\n,\\nMartin\\u00a0Van\\u00a0Buren\\n, and\\nWoodrow\\u00a0Wilson\\nDemocratic-Republican\\n4\\nJohn\\u00a0Quincy\\u00a0Adams\\n,\\nThomas\\u00a0Jefferson\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Madison\\n, and\\nJames\\u00a0Monroe\\nWhig\\n4\\nMillard\\u00a0Fillmore\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Henry\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nZachary\\u00a0Taylor\\n, and\\nJohn\\u00a0Tyler\\n[\\nH\\n]\\nFederalist\\n1\\nJohn\\u00a0Adams\\nNational Union\\n1\\nAndrew\\u00a0Johnson\\n[\\nI\\n]\\nIndependent\\n(No party)\\n1\\nGeorge\\u00a0Washington\\nTimeline of presidents\\nSee also:\\nList of presidents of the United States\\nThe following\\ntimeline\\ndepicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.\\nSee also\\nUnited States portal\\nPolitics portal\\nOutline of American politics\\nNotes\\n^\\nIn addition to $100,000 in travel reimbursement, $19,000 for entertainment and $50,000 for additional expenses.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\n^\\nThe informal term POTUS originated in the\\nPhillips Code\\n, a shorthand method created in 1879 by\\nWalter P.

Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

The new government did not commence until the old government expired.

In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members. It existed potentially until March 2, the day preceding that on which the members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\\\"\\nOwings v.

The president directs the\\nexecutive branch\\nof the\\nfederal government\\nand is the\\ncommander-in-chief\\nof the\\nUnited States Armed Forces\\n.\\nThe power of the presidency has grown\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nsince the first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\n, took office in 1789.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nWhile presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasing role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with some expansions during the presidencies of\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nand\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining\\nsuperpower\\n.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nAs the leader of the nation with the\\nlargest economy by nominal GDP\\n, the president possesses significant domestic and international\\nhard\\nand\\nsoft power\\n. For much of the 20th century, especially during the\\nCold War\\n, the U.S. president was often called \\\"the leader of the free world\\\".\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nArticle II of the Constitution\\nestablishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's\\nmost expensive military\\n, which has the\\nsecond-largest nuclear arsenal\\n.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of\\nseparation of powers\\n,\\nArticle I, Section\\n7\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or\\nveto\\nfederal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is\\nelected indirectly\\nthrough the\\nElectoral College\\nto a four-year term, along with the\\nvice president\\n. Under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a\\npresident's intra-term death\\nor\\nresignation\\n.\\n[\\nC\\n]\\nIn all,\\n45 individuals\\nhave served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.\\n[\\nD\\n]\\nDonald Trump\\nis the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\nIn July 1776, the\\nThirteen Colonies\\n, represented at the\\nSecond Continental Congress\\nin\\nPhiladelphia\\n, unanimously adopted the\\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\\nin which the colonies declared themselves to be independent\\nsovereign states\\nand no longer under\\nBritish\\nrule.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe affirmation was made in the\\nDeclaration of Independence\\n, which was written predominantly by\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the\\nBritish\\n,\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nthe Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates\\ntogether. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nCongress finished work on the\\nArticles of Confederation\\nto establish a\\nperpetual union\\nbetween the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for\\nratification\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nUnder the Articles, which\\ntook effect\\non March 1, 1781, the\\nCongress of the Confederation\\nwas a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThis institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of\\nCrown\\nand\\nParliament\\nought to have functioned with respect to the royal\\ndominion\\n: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly\\nroyal prerogatives\\n(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a\\npresident of the United States in Congress Assembled\\nto preside over its deliberation as a neutral\\ndiscussion moderator\\n. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1783, the\\nTreaty of Paris\\nsecured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nBy 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their\\nhard currency\\npouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their\\nMediterranean\\ncommerce preyed upon by\\nNorth African\\npirates\\n, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nCivil and political unrest loomed.  Events such as the\\nNewburgh Conspiracy\\nand\\nShays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between\\nVirginia\\nand Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference\\nin 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in\\nAnnapolis, Maryland\\n, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the\\nconvention\\nfailed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states,\\nAlexander Hamilton\\nof New York led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in\\nPhiladelphia\\n. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nEdmund Randolph\\nsucceeded in securing\\nGeorge Washington\\n's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nWhen the\\nConstitutional Convention\\nconvened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (\\nRhode Island\\ndid not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nNew York\\noffered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIt was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the\\nU.S. Constitution\\nemerged.\\n1789\\u20131933\\nGeorge Washington\\n, the first president of the United States\\nAs the nation's first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\nestablished many norms that would come to define the office.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nHis decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the\\nTwenty-Second Amendment\\n. By the end of his presidency, political parties had developed,\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nwith\\nJohn Adams\\ndefeating\\nThomas Jefferson\\nin 1796, the first truly contested presidential election.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nAfter Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow Virginians\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nJames Monroe\\nwould each serve two terms, eventually dominating the nation's politics during the\\nEra of Good Feelings\\nuntil Adams' son\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwon election in 1824 after the\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\nsplit.\\nThe election of\\nAndrew Jackson\\nin 1828 was a significant milestone, as Jackson was not part of the Virginia and Massachusetts elite that had held the presidency for its first 40 years.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nJacksonian democracy\\nsought to strengthen the presidency at the expense of Congress, while broadening public participation as the nation rapidly expanded westward. However, his successor,\\nMartin Van Buren\\n, became unpopular after the\\nPanic of 1837\\n,\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nand the death of\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nand subsequent poor relations between\\nJohn Tyler\\nand Congress led to further weakening of the office.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nIncluding Van Buren, in the 24 years between 1837 and 1861, six presidential terms would be filled by eight different men, with none serving two terms.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nThe Senate played an important role during this period, with the\\nGreat Triumvirate\\nof\\nHenry Clay\\n,\\nDaniel Webster\\n, and\\nJohn C. Calhoun\\nplaying key roles in shaping national policy in the 1830s and 1840s until debates over slavery began pulling the nation apart in the 1850s.\\n[\\n35\\n]\\n[\\n36\\n]\\nAbraham Lincoln\\n's leadership during the\\nCivil War\\nhas led historians to regard him as one of the nation's greatest presidents.\\n[\\nE\\n]\\nThe circumstances of the war and Republican domination of Congress made the office very powerful,\\n[\\n37\\n]\\n[\\n38\\n]\\nand Lincoln's re-election in 1864 was the first time a president had been re-elected since Jackson in 1832. After Lincoln's assassination, his successor\\nAndrew Johnson\\nlost all political support\\n[\\n39\\n]\\nand was nearly removed from office,\\n[\\n40\\n]\\nwith Congress remaining powerful during the two-term presidency of Civil War general\\nUlysses S. Grant\\n. After the end of\\nReconstruction\\n,\\nGrover Cleveland\\nwould eventually become the first Democratic president elected since before the war, running in three consecutive elections (1884, 1888, 1892) and winning twice. In 1900,\\nWilliam McKinley\\nbecame the first incumbent to win re-election since Grant in 1872.\\nAfter McKinley's\\nassassination\\nby\\nLeon Czolgosz\\nin 1901,\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\nbecame a dominant figure in American politics.\\n[\\n41\\n]\\nHistorians believe Roosevelt permanently changed the political system by strengthening the presidency,\\n[\\n42\\n]\\nwith some key accomplishments including breaking up trusts, conservationism, labor reforms, making personal character as important as the issues, and hand-picking his successor,\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\n. The following decade,\\nWoodrow Wilson\\nled the nation to victory during\\nWorld War I\\n, although Wilson's proposal for the\\nLeague of Nations\\nwas rejected by the Senate.\\n[\\n43\\n]\\nWarren Harding\\n, while popular in office, would see his legacy tarnished by scandals, especially\\nTeapot Dome\\n,\\n[\\n44\\n]\\nand\\nHerbert Hoover\\nquickly became very unpopular after failing to alleviate the\\nGreat Depression\\n.\\n[\\n45\\n]\\nImperial presidency\\nMain article:\\nImperial presidency\\nPresident\\nFranklin D.

Johnson\\nlost popular support due to the\\nVietnam War\\nand\\nRichard Nixon\\n's presidency collapsed in the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, Congress enacted a series of reforms intended to reassert itself.\\n[\\n50\\n]\\n[\\n51\\n]\\nThese included the\\nWar Powers Resolution\\n, enacted over Nixon's veto in 1973,\\n[\\n52\\n]\\n[\\n53\\n]\\nand the\\nCongressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974\\nthat sought to strengthen congressional fiscal powers.\\n[\\n54\\n]\\nBy 1976,\\nGerald Ford\\nconceded that \\\"the historic pendulum\\\" had swung toward Congress, raising the possibility of a \\\"disruptive\\\" erosion of his ability to govern.\\n[\\n55\\n]\\nFord failed to win election to a full term and his successor,\\nJimmy Carter\\n, failed to win re-election.\\nRonald Reagan\\n, who had been an actor before beginning his political career, used his talent as a communicator to help reshape the American agenda away from New Deal policies toward more conservative ideology.\\n[\\n56\\n]\\n[\\n57\\n]\\nAfter the Cold War, the United States became the world's undisputed leading power.\\n[\\n58\\n]\\nBill Clinton\\n,\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n, and\\nBarack Obama\\neach served two terms as president. Meanwhile, the nation gradually became more politically polarized, leading to the ascendency of increasingly polarized Congressmembers, especially following the\\n1994 mid-term elections\\nwhich saw Republicans control the House for the first time in 40 years, and the rise of routine\\nfilibusters\\nin the Senate.\\n[\\n59\\n]\\nRecent presidents have thus increasingly focused on\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to implement major policies, at the expense of legislation and congressional power.\\n[\\n60\\n]\\nPresidential elections in the 21st century have reflected this continuing polarization, with no candidate except Obama in 2008 winning by more than five percent of the popular vote and two, George W. Bush (\\n2000\\n) and\\nDonald Trump\\n(\\n2016\\n), winning in the Electoral College while losing the popular vote.\\n[\\nF\\n]\\nBush (\\n2004\\n) and Trump (\\n2024\\n) were later re-elected, winning both in the Electoral College and the popular vote.\\nCritics of presidency's evolution\\nThe nation's\\nFounding Fathers\\nexpected the\\nCongress\\n, which was the first branch of government described in the\\nConstitution\\n, to be the dominant branch of government; they did not expect a strong executive department.\\n[\\n61\\n]\\nHowever, presidential power has shifted over time, which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful,\\n[\\n62\\n]\\n[\\n63\\n]\\nunchecked, unbalanced,\\n[\\n64\\n]\\nand \\\"monarchist\\\" in nature.\\n[\\n65\\n]\\nIn 2008 professor\\nDana D. Nelson\\nexpressed belief that presidents over the previous thirty years worked towards \\\"undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies\\\".\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nShe criticized proponents of the\\nunitary executive theory\\nfor expanding \\\"the many existing uncheckable executive powers\\u2014such as executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements\\u2014that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid, interference or consent from Congress\\\".\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nBill Wilson\\n, board member of\\nAmericans for Limited Government\\n, opined that the expanded presidency was \\\"the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rule\\\".\\n[\\n67\\n]\\nLegislative powers\\nArticle I, Section\\n1\\nof the Constitution vests all\\nlawmaking power\\nin Congress's hands, and\\nArticle 1, Section 6, Clause\\n2\\nprevents the president (and all other executive branch officers) from simultaneously being a member of Congress. Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nPresident\\nLyndon B. Johnson\\nsigns the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act\\nat the\\nWhite House\\non July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\nand others look on.\\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the\\nPresentment Clause\\n, which gives the president the power to veto any\\nbill\\npassed by\\nCongress\\n. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\nof both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.  The veto \\u2013 or threat of a veto \\u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\nSign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill\\nbecomes law\\n.\\nVeto\\nthe legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\n.\\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto\\n.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the\\nLine Item Veto Act\\n. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In\\nClinton v. City of New York\\n,\\n524\\nU.S.\\n417\\n(1998), the\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nSetting the agenda\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump\\ndelivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore\\nCongress\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \\\"necessary and expedient\\\". This is done through the constitutionally-based\\nState of the Union\\naddress, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nPresidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of\\nagencies\\nthat can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\\"virtual army of 'czars'\\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\\".\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nPresidents have been criticized for making\\nsigning statements\\nwhen signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nThis practice has been criticized by the\\nAmerican Bar Association\\nas unconstitutional.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nConservative commentator\\nGeorge Will\\nwrote of an \\\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\\" and \\\"the eclipse of Congress\\\".\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by\\nArticle II, Section\\n3\\nof the Constitution to call a\\nspecial session\\nof one or both houses of Congress. Since\\nJohn Adams\\nfirst did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions.\\nHarry S. Truman\\nwas the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the\\nTurnip Day Session\\n. In addition, prior to ratification of the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\nin 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly\\ninaugurated\\npresidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nExecutive powers\\nMain article:\\nPowers of the president of the United States\\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

However, these nominations require\\nSenate confirmation\\nbefore they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to\\nU.S. district courts\\n, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of\\nsenatorial courtesy\\n. Presidents may also grant\\npardons\\nand\\nreprieves\\n.\\nGerald Ford\\npardoned\\nRichard Nixon\\na month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when\\nBill Clinton\\npardoned\\nPatty Hearst\\non his last day in office; this is often\\ncontroversial\\n.\\n[\\n98\\n]\\n[\\n99\\n]\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is\\nexecutive privilege\\n, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see\\nChief Justice\\nJohn Jay\\n's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain\\n. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nUnited States v. Nixon\\n, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the\\nLewinsky scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nClinton v. Jones\\n, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the\\nlegal precedent\\nthat executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nThe\\nstate secrets privilege\\nallows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from\\ndiscovery\\nin legal proceedings if such release would harm\\nnational security\\n. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when\\nThomas Jefferson\\nrefused to release military documents in the\\ntreason\\ntrial of\\nAaron Burr\\nand again in\\nTotten v. United States\\n, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHowever, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until\\nUnited States v. Reynolds\\n, where it was held to be a\\ncommon law\\nevidentiary\\nprivilege.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nBefore the\\nSeptember 11 attacks\\n, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nSince 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the\\nNinth Circuit\\n's ruling in\\nMohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nCritics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has\\nabsolute immunity\\nfrom court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions.\\nNixon v. Fitzgerald\\n(1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions.\\nClinton v. Jones\\n(1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019\\nMueller report\\non Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible\\nobstruction of justice\\n, but investigators declined to refer\\nDonald Trump\\nfor prosecution based on a\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\npolicy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy.

Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration\\npublic relations\\nofficials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\\"propagandized leadership\\\" which has a \\\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\\".\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nAdministration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops\\nof smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nOne critic wrote the image of John F.

With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party's voters.  Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The\\ncoattail effect\\n, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.  Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\nGlobal leader\\nWith the rise of the United States as a\\nsuperpower\\nin the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of\\nNATO\\n, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the\\nEuropean Union\\n, have led to the moniker that the president is the \\\"\\nleader of the free world\\n\\\".\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5\\nof the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\nbe a\\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\\n;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a\\nresident in the United States\\nfor at least 14 years.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 7\\n, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nUnder\\nSection 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment\\n, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nThere is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding\\nConfederates\\nfrom public office after the Civil War.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nUnder the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nPrior experience\\nMain articles:\\nList of presidents of the United States by other offices held\\n,\\nList of presidents of the United States by previous experience\\n, and\\nList of presidents of the United States by education\\nThere are no requirements for previous or concurrent offices held by the President or presidential candidates.

They typically vote for the candidates of the\\nparty\\nthat nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are\\npledged\\n.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nThe constitutionality of these laws was upheld in\\nChiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nFollowing the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an\\nabsolute majority\\nof electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the\\nHouse of Representatives\\nmust meet to elect a president using a\\ncontingent election\\nprocedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top\\nthree\\nelectoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\\u201373 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand fellow Democratic-Republican\\nAaron Burr\\nin the\\nelection of 1800\\nnecessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n3\\nof the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the\\nrunner-up\\nwould become vice president.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nOn February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president.

This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution:\\nI do solemnly swear (or\\naffirm\\n) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nPresidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a\\nBible\\nwhile taking the oath, and have added \\\"So help me God\\\" to the end of the oath.\\n[\\n151\\n]\\n[\\n152\\n]\\nAlthough the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the\\nchief justice of the United States\\n.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nIncumbency\\nTerm limit\\nPresident\\nWilliam McKinley\\nand his vice presidential running mate, New York Governor\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\n,\\nc.\\n1900\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nwon a record four\\npresidential elections\\nin\\n1932\\n,\\n1936\\n,\\n1940\\n, and\\n1944\\nprior to the implementation of the\\n22nd amendment\\nin 1951, which instituted a two-term limit.\\nWhen the first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\n, announced in his\\nFarewell Address\\nthat he was not running for a third term, he established a \\\"two terms then out\\\" precedent. Precedent became tradition after\\nThomas Jefferson\\npublicly embraced the principle a decade later during his second term, as did his two immediate successors,\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nJames Monroe\\n.\\n[\\n153\\n]\\nIn spite of the strong two-term tradition,\\nUlysses S. Grant\\nsought nomination at the\\n1880 Republican National Convention\\nfor a non-consecutive third term, but was unsuccessful.\\n[\\n154\\n]\\nIn 1940, after leading the nation through the\\nGreat Depression\\nand focused on supporting U.S.\\nallied nations\\nat war with the\\nAxis powers\\n, Franklin Roosevelt was elected to a third term, breaking the long-standing precedent. Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in\\nWorld War II\\n, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nIn response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\nwas\\nadopted\\nin 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term.\\nHarry S. Truman\\n, the president at the time it was submitted to the states by the Congress, was exempted from its limitations. Without the exemption, he would not have been eligible to run for a second full term in 1952 (which he briefly sought), as he had served nearly all of Franklin Roosevelt's unexpired 1945\\u20131949 term and had been elected to a full four-year term beginning in 1949.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nVacancies and succession\\nUnder\\nSection\\n1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment\\n, ratified in 1967, the vice president becomes president upon the\\nremoval from office\\n, death, or resignation of the president. Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession),\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6\\n, stated only that the vice president assumes the \\\"powers and duties\\\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nUnder this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply\\nact\\nas president,\\n[\\n157\\n]\\npotentially resulting in a\\nspecial election\\n. Upon the death of President\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nin 1841, Vice President\\nJohn Tyler\\ndeclared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \\\"Acting President\\\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\\\".\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nThe\\nPresidential Succession Act\\nof 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C. \\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the\\npresidential line of succession\\nfollows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments\\nwho form the president's\\ncabinet\\n. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nDeclarations of inability\\nMain article:\\nTwenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes\\nacting president\\n, by transmitting to the\\nspeaker of the House\\nand the\\npresident\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate\\na statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by\\nRonald Reagan\\n(once),\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n(twice), and\\nJoe Biden\\n(once), each in anticipation of surgery.\\n[\\n159\\n]\\n[\\n160\\n]\\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment also provides that the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the\\nCabinet\\n, may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration, to the speaker of the House and the president\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate, to the effect that the president is unable to discharge his or her powers and duties. If the president then declares that no such inability exist, he or she resumes the presidential powers unless the vice president and Cabinet make a second declaration of presidential inability, in which case Congress decides the question.\\nRemoval\\nMain articles:\\nList of efforts to impeach presidents of the United States\\n,\\nFederal impeachment in the United States\\n, and\\nFederal impeachment trial in the United States\\nArticle II, Section 4\\nof the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \\\"\\ntreason\\n,\\nbribery\\n, or other\\nhigh crimes and misdemeanors\\n\\\".\\nArticle I, Section 2, Clause\\n5\\nauthorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a \\\"\\ngrand jury\\n\\\" with the power to impeach said officials by a majority vote.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause\\n6\\nauthorizes the Senate to serve as a\\ncourt\\nwith the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict.\\n[\\n162\\n]\\nThree presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in\\n1868\\n, Bill Clinton in\\n1998\\n, and Donald Trump in\\n2019\\nand\\n2021\\n; none have been convicted by the Senate. Additionally, the\\nHouse Judiciary Committee\\nconducted an impeachment inquiry against Richard Nixon in\\n1973\\u201374\\nand reported  three articles of impeachment to the House of Representatives for final action; however, he resigned from office before the House voted on them.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nCircumvention of authority\\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the part of the president, or with a long-term disability. In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders. This has ranged from\\nRichard Nixon\\n's Chief of Staff not transmitting orders to the Cabinet due to the president's heavy drinking, to staff removing memos from\\nDonald Trump\\n's desk.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nDecades before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a\\nstroke that left him partly incapacitated\\n.

In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the\\nBoeing C-32\\n, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet.

Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House:\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwas elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for 17 years, and\\nAndrew Johnson\\nreturned to the Senate in 1875, though he died soon after.

During his presidency, George W. Bush called on former presidents George H. W. Bush and Clinton to assist with humanitarian efforts after the\\n2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami\\n. President Obama followed suit by asking presidents Clinton and George W. Bush to lead efforts to aid Haiti after an\\nearthquake\\ndevastated that country in 2010.  Clinton's relationship with the two Bushes is not the first friendship between former presidents: Carter enjoyed a friendship and correspondence with\\nGerald Ford\\n, while Jefferson and\\nJohn Adams\\nhad an extended correspondence through letters in their post-presidencies.\\nClinton has been active politically since his presidential term ended\\n, working with his wife\\nHillary\\non her\\n2008\\nand\\n2016\\npresidential bids and President Obama on his\\n2012 reelection campaign\\n.

The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff.  The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by\\nimpeachment\\n.\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nAccording to a 2008 report by the\\nCongressional Research Service\\n:\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nChief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nFormer presidents who served in Congress may also collect\\ncongressional pensions\\n.\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nThe act also provides former presidents with travel funds and\\nfranking\\nprivileges.\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.\\n[\\n189\\n]\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nIn 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nOn January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him,\\nGeorge W.

Some even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document:\\nThe\\nHarry S.

In some cases (such as with Nixon), the presidential library is adjacent to one of the president's former homes, where in other cases, such as with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, the presidential library and the historic site are in different cities entirely.\\nPolitical affiliation\\nPolitical parties\\nhave dominated\\nAmerican politics\\nfor most of the nation's history. Though the\\nFounding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from\\npolitical factions\\n, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the\\nWashington administration\\nwere referred to as \\\"pro-administration\\\" and would eventually form the\\nFederalist Party\\n, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\n.\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained\\nunaffiliated\\nwith any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.\\n[\\n196\\n]\\n[\\n197\\n]\\nSince Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office, and, since 1869, every president has been a member of either the\\nRepublican\\nor\\nDemocratic\\nParties.\\n[\\n198\\n]\\n[\\n199\\n]\\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\\nParty\\nNumber of\\npresidents\\nName(s)\\nRepublican\\n19\\nChester\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Arthur\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0H.\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nCalvin\\u00a0Coolidge\\n,\\nDwight\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Eisenhower\\n,\\nGerald\\u00a0Ford\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Garfield\\n,\\nUlysses\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Grant\\n,\\nWarren\\u00a0G.\\u00a0Harding\\n,\\nBenjamin\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nRutherford\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Hayes\\n,\\nHerbert\\u00a0Hoover\\n,\\nAbraham\\u00a0Lincoln\\n,\\n[\\nG\\n]\\nWilliam\\u00a0McKinley\\n,\\nRichard\\u00a0Nixon\\n,\\nRonald\\u00a0Reagan\\n,\\nTheodore\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Howard\\u00a0Taft\\n, and\\nDonald\\u00a0Trump\\n(incumbent)\\nDemocratic\\n15\\nJoe Biden\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Buchanan\\n,\\nJimmy\\u00a0Carter\\n,\\nGrover\\u00a0Cleveland\\n,\\nBill\\u00a0Clinton\\n,\\nAndrew\\u00a0Jackson\\n,\\nLyndon\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Johnson\\n,\\nJohn\\u00a0F.\\u00a0Kennedy\\n,\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0Pierce\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0K.\\u00a0Polk\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nHarry\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Truman\\n,\\nMartin\\u00a0Van\\u00a0Buren\\n, and\\nWoodrow\\u00a0Wilson\\nDemocratic-Republican\\n4\\nJohn\\u00a0Quincy\\u00a0Adams\\n,\\nThomas\\u00a0Jefferson\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Madison\\n, and\\nJames\\u00a0Monroe\\nWhig\\n4\\nMillard\\u00a0Fillmore\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Henry\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nZachary\\u00a0Taylor\\n, and\\nJohn\\u00a0Tyler\\n[\\nH\\n]\\nFederalist\\n1\\nJohn\\u00a0Adams\\nNational Union\\n1\\nAndrew\\u00a0Johnson\\n[\\nI\\n]\\nIndependent\\n(No party)\\n1\\nGeorge\\u00a0Washington\\nTimeline of presidents\\nSee also:\\nList of presidents of the United States\\nThe following\\ntimeline\\ndepicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.\\nSee also\\nUnited States portal\\nPolitics portal\\nOutline of American politics\\nNotes\\n^\\nIn addition to $100,000 in travel reimbursement, $19,000 for entertainment and $50,000 for additional expenses.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\n^\\nThe informal term POTUS originated in the\\nPhillips Code\\n, a shorthand method created in 1879 by\\nWalter P.

The new government did not commence until the old government expired. It is apparent that the government did not commence on the Constitution's being ratified by the ninth state, for these ratifications were to be reported to Congress, whose continuing existence was recognized by the Convention, and who were requested to continue to exercise their powers for the purpose of bringing the new government into operation. In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members. It existed potentially until March 2, the day preceding that on which the members of the new Congress were directed to assemble.\\\"\\nOwings v.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

The president directs the\\nexecutive branch\\nof the\\nfederal government\\nand is the\\ncommander-in-chief\\nof the\\nUnited States Armed Forces\\n.\\nThe power of the presidency has grown\\n[\\n12\\n]\\nsince the first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\n, took office in 1789.\\n[\\n6\\n]\\nWhile presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasing role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with some expansions during the presidencies of\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nand\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining\\nsuperpower\\n.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nAs the leader of the nation with the\\nlargest economy by nominal GDP\\n, the president possesses significant domestic and international\\nhard\\nand\\nsoft power\\n. For much of the 20th century, especially during the\\nCold War\\n, the U.S. president was often called \\\"the leader of the free world\\\".\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nArticle II of the Constitution\\nestablishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's\\nmost expensive military\\n, which has the\\nsecond-largest nuclear arsenal\\n.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of\\nseparation of powers\\n,\\nArticle I, Section\\n7\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or\\nveto\\nfederal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is\\nelected indirectly\\nthrough the\\nElectoral College\\nto a four-year term, along with the\\nvice president\\n. Under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a\\npresident's intra-term death\\nor\\nresignation\\n.\\n[\\nC\\n]\\nIn all,\\n45 individuals\\nhave served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.\\n[\\nD\\n]\\nDonald Trump\\nis the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\nIn July 1776, the\\nThirteen Colonies\\n, represented at the\\nSecond Continental Congress\\nin\\nPhiladelphia\\n, unanimously adopted the\\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\\nin which the colonies declared themselves to be independent\\nsovereign states\\nand no longer under\\nBritish\\nrule.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe affirmation was made in the\\nDeclaration of Independence\\n, which was written predominantly by\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the\\nBritish\\n,\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nthe Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates\\ntogether. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nCongress finished work on the\\nArticles of Confederation\\nto establish a\\nperpetual union\\nbetween the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for\\nratification\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nUnder the Articles, which\\ntook effect\\non March 1, 1781, the\\nCongress of the Confederation\\nwas a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThis institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of\\nCrown\\nand\\nParliament\\nought to have functioned with respect to the royal\\ndominion\\n: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly\\nroyal prerogatives\\n(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a\\npresident of the United States in Congress Assembled\\nto preside over its deliberation as a neutral\\ndiscussion moderator\\n. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1783, the\\nTreaty of Paris\\nsecured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nBy 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their\\nhard currency\\npouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their\\nMediterranean\\ncommerce preyed upon by\\nNorth African\\npirates\\n, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nCivil and political unrest loomed.  Events such as the\\nNewburgh Conspiracy\\nand\\nShays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between\\nVirginia\\nand Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference\\nin 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in\\nAnnapolis, Maryland\\n, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms.

Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nPresident\\nLyndon B. Johnson\\nsigns the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act\\nat the\\nWhite House\\non July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\nand others look on.\\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the\\nPresentment Clause\\n, which gives the president the power to veto any\\nbill\\npassed by\\nCongress\\n. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\nof both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.  The veto \\u2013 or threat of a veto \\u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\nSign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill\\nbecomes law\\n.\\nVeto\\nthe legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\n.\\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto\\n.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the\\nLine Item Veto Act\\n. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In\\nClinton v. City of New York\\n,\\n524\\nU.S.\\n417\\n(1998), the\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nSetting the agenda\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump\\ndelivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore\\nCongress\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \\\"necessary and expedient\\\". This is done through the constitutionally-based\\nState of the Union\\naddress, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nPresidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of\\nagencies\\nthat can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\\"virtual army of 'czars'\\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\\".\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nPresidents have been criticized for making\\nsigning statements\\nwhen signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nThis practice has been criticized by the\\nAmerican Bar Association\\nas unconstitutional.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nConservative commentator\\nGeorge Will\\nwrote of an \\\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\\" and \\\"the eclipse of Congress\\\".\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by\\nArticle II, Section\\n3\\nof the Constitution to call a\\nspecial session\\nof one or both houses of Congress. Since\\nJohn Adams\\nfirst did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions.\\nHarry S. Truman\\nwas the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the\\nTurnip Day Session\\n. In addition, prior to ratification of the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\nin 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly\\ninaugurated\\npresidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nExecutive powers\\nMain article:\\nPowers of the president of the United States\\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

However, these nominations require\\nSenate confirmation\\nbefore they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to\\nU.S. district courts\\n, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of\\nsenatorial courtesy\\n. Presidents may also grant\\npardons\\nand\\nreprieves\\n.\\nGerald Ford\\npardoned\\nRichard Nixon\\na month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when\\nBill Clinton\\npardoned\\nPatty Hearst\\non his last day in office; this is often\\ncontroversial\\n.\\n[\\n98\\n]\\n[\\n99\\n]\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is\\nexecutive privilege\\n, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see\\nChief Justice\\nJohn Jay\\n's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain\\n. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nUnited States v. Nixon\\n, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the\\nLewinsky scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nClinton v. Jones\\n, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the\\nlegal precedent\\nthat executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nThe\\nstate secrets privilege\\nallows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from\\ndiscovery\\nin legal proceedings if such release would harm\\nnational security\\n. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when\\nThomas Jefferson\\nrefused to release military documents in the\\ntreason\\ntrial of\\nAaron Burr\\nand again in\\nTotten v. United States\\n, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHowever, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until\\nUnited States v. Reynolds\\n, where it was held to be a\\ncommon law\\nevidentiary\\nprivilege.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nBefore the\\nSeptember 11 attacks\\n, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nSince 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the\\nNinth Circuit\\n's ruling in\\nMohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nCritics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has\\nabsolute immunity\\nfrom court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions.\\nNixon v. Fitzgerald\\n(1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions.\\nClinton v. Jones\\n(1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019\\nMueller report\\non Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible\\nobstruction of justice\\n, but investigators declined to refer\\nDonald Trump\\nfor prosecution based on a\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\npolicy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy.

Hayes\\nbegan in 1878 the first White House\\negg rolling\\nfor local children.\\n[\\n117\\n]\\nBeginning in 1947, during the\\nHarry S. Truman\\nadministration, every\\nThanksgiving\\nthe president is presented with a live domestic turkey during the annual\\nNational Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation\\nheld at the White House. Since 1989, when the custom of \\\"pardoning\\\" the turkey was formalized by\\nGeorge H. W. Bush\\n, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.\\n[\\n118\\n]\\nPresidential traditions also involve the president's role as head of government. Many outgoing presidents since\\nJames Buchanan\\ntraditionally give advice to their successor during the\\npresidential transition\\n.\\n[\\n119\\n]\\nRonald Reagan\\nand his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on\\nInauguration Day\\nfor the incoming president.\\n[\\n120\\n]\\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration\\npublic relations\\nofficials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\\"propagandized leadership\\\" which has a \\\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\\".\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nAdministration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops\\nof smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nOne critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \\\"in rich detail\\\" which \\\"drew on the power of myth\\\" regarding the incident of\\nPT 109\\n[\\n123\\n]\\nand wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.\\n[\\n124\\n]\\nAs a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \\\"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\\\".\\n[\\n125\\n]\\nHead of party\\nThe president is typically considered to be the\\nde facto\\nhead and spokesperson of their political party.  With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party's voters.  Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The\\ncoattail effect\\n, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.  Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\nGlobal leader\\nWith the rise of the United States as a\\nsuperpower\\nin the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of\\nNATO\\n, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the\\nEuropean Union\\n, have led to the moniker that the president is the \\\"\\nleader of the free world\\n\\\".\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5\\nof the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\nbe a\\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\\n;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a\\nresident in the United States\\nfor at least 14 years.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 7\\n, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nUnder\\nSection 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment\\n, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nThere is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding\\nConfederates\\nfrom public office after the Civil War.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nUnder the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nPrior experience\\nMain articles:\\nList of presidents of the United States by other offices held\\n,\\nList of presidents of the United States by previous experience\\n, and\\nList of presidents of the United States by education\\nThere are no requirements for previous or concurrent offices held by the President or presidential candidates.  However, every President except Donald Trump has been a\\ngovernor\\n,\\nU.S. senator\\nor\\nCongressman\\n,\\ngeneral\\nor\\ncabinet member\\n.\\nThe most common previous profession of presidents is lawyer, applying to 27 of the 45 men who have served as President.\\n[\\n133\\n]\\nHowever, several future Presidents abandoned the study or practice of law prior to the Presidency.  There has never been a property qualification for the Presidency or other federal offices, but, in the early years of the republic, there were\\nproperty qualifications for voting\\nor for some of the stepping-stone offices to the Presidency (particularly governorships).  Prior to the Civil War, it was common for presidents to be men of significant property: Presidents from the North tended to own small farms, while several Southern presidents owned plantations and\\nslaves\\n.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n[\\n135\\n]\\nWhile several later presidents came from abject poverty, others, such as the Roosevelts, John Kennedy, and Donald Trump, were parties to extensive family fortunes.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n33 of the 45 men who served as President, including every president since 1953 and all but one since 1901, have had a bachelor's degree.

Typically, the party's presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee, and this choice is\\nrubber-stamped\\nby the convention.\\nNominees participate in\\nnationally televised debates\\n, and while the debates are usually restricted to the\\nDemocratic\\nand\\nRepublican\\nnominees,\\nthird party\\ncandidates may be invited, such as\\nRoss Perot\\nin the 1992 debates.

As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the\\nTwenty-third Amendment\\nprovides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.\\n[\\n136\\n]\\nCurrently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nIn all but two states, the party whose presidential\\u2013vice presidential\\nticket\\nreceives a\\nplurality\\nof popular votes in the state has its entire\\nslate\\nof elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nMaine\\nand\\nNebraska\\ndeviate from this\\nwinner-take-all\\npractice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each\\ncongressional district\\n.\\n[\\n139\\n]\\n[\\n140\\n]\\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the\\nparty\\nthat nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are\\npledged\\n.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nThe constitutionality of these laws was upheld in\\nChiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nFollowing the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an\\nabsolute majority\\nof electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the\\nHouse of Representatives\\nmust meet to elect a president using a\\ncontingent election\\nprocedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top\\nthree\\nelectoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\\u201373 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand fellow Democratic-Republican\\nAaron Burr\\nin the\\nelection of 1800\\nnecessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n3\\nof the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the\\nrunner-up\\nwould become vice president.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nOn February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the\\nTwelfth Amendment\\nin time to be used in the\\n1804 election\\n.\\n[\\n145\\n]\\nA quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the\\nelection of 1824\\n. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients:\\nAndrew Jackson\\n,\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\n, and\\nWilliam H. Crawford\\n. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.\\n[\\n146\\n]\\nInauguration\\nMain article:\\nUnited States presidential inauguration\\nPursuant to the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\n, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election.\\n[\\n147\\n]\\nThe first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as\\nInauguration Day\\n, were the\\nsecond terms\\nof President\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt\\nand Vice President\\nJohn Nance Garner\\nin 1937.\\n[\\n148\\n]\\nPreviously, Inauguration Day was on March 4. As a result of the date change, the first term (1933\\u201337) of both men had been shortened by 43 days.\\n[\\n149\\n]\\nBefore executing the powers of the office, a president is required to\\nrecite\\nthe\\npresidential Oath of Office\\n, found in\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n8 of the Constitution\\n. This is the only component in the inauguration ceremony mandated by the Constitution:\\nI do solemnly swear (or\\naffirm\\n) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nPresidents have traditionally placed one hand upon a\\nBible\\nwhile taking the oath, and have added \\\"So help me God\\\" to the end of the oath.\\n[\\n151\\n]\\n[\\n152\\n]\\nAlthough the oath may be administered by any person authorized by law to administer oaths, presidents are traditionally sworn in by the\\nchief justice of the United States\\n.\\n[\\n150\\n]\\nIncumbency\\nTerm limit\\nPresident\\nWilliam McKinley\\nand his vice presidential running mate, New York Governor\\nTheodore Roosevelt\\n,\\nc.\\n1900\\nFranklin D.

Four years later, with the U.S. engaged in\\nWorld War II\\n, he was re-elected again despite his declining physical health; he died 82 days into his fourth term on April 12, 1945.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nIn response to the unprecedented length of Roosevelt's presidency, the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\nwas\\nadopted\\nin 1951. The amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice, or once if that person served more than two years (24 months) of another president's four-year term.\\nHarry S. Truman\\n, the president at the time it was submitted to the states by the Congress, was exempted from its limitations. Without the exemption, he would not have been eligible to run for a second full term in 1952 (which he briefly sought), as he had served nearly all of Franklin Roosevelt's unexpired 1945\\u20131949 term and had been elected to a full four-year term beginning in 1949.\\n[\\n155\\n]\\nVacancies and succession\\nUnder\\nSection\\n1 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment\\n, ratified in 1967, the vice president becomes president upon the\\nremoval from office\\n, death, or resignation of the president. Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession),\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6\\n, stated only that the vice president assumes the \\\"powers and duties\\\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nUnder this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply\\nact\\nas president,\\n[\\n157\\n]\\npotentially resulting in a\\nspecial election\\n. Upon the death of President\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nin 1841, Vice President\\nJohn Tyler\\ndeclared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \\\"Acting President\\\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\\\".\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nThe\\nPresidential Succession Act\\nof 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C. \\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the\\npresidential line of succession\\nfollows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments\\nwho form the president's\\ncabinet\\n. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nDeclarations of inability\\nMain article:\\nTwenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes\\nacting president\\n, by transmitting to the\\nspeaker of the House\\nand the\\npresident\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate\\na statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by\\nRonald Reagan\\n(once),\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n(twice), and\\nJoe Biden\\n(once), each in anticipation of surgery.\\n[\\n159\\n]\\n[\\n160\\n]\\nThe Twenty-fifth Amendment also provides that the vice president, together with a majority of certain members of the\\nCabinet\\n, may transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration, to the speaker of the House and the president\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate, to the effect that the president is unable to discharge his or her powers and duties. If the president then declares that no such inability exist, he or she resumes the presidential powers unless the vice president and Cabinet make a second declaration of presidential inability, in which case Congress decides the question.\\nRemoval\\nMain articles:\\nList of efforts to impeach presidents of the United States\\n,\\nFederal impeachment in the United States\\n, and\\nFederal impeachment trial in the United States\\nArticle II, Section 4\\nof the Constitution allows for the removal of high federal officials, including the president, from office for \\\"\\ntreason\\n,\\nbribery\\n, or other\\nhigh crimes and misdemeanors\\n\\\".\\nArticle I, Section 2, Clause\\n5\\nauthorizes the House of Representatives to serve as a \\\"\\ngrand jury\\n\\\" with the power to impeach said officials by a majority vote.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause\\n6\\nauthorizes the Senate to serve as a\\ncourt\\nwith the power to remove impeached officials from office, by a two-thirds vote to convict.\\n[\\n162\\n]\\nThree presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives: Andrew Johnson in\\n1868\\n, Bill Clinton in\\n1998\\n, and Donald Trump in\\n2019\\nand\\n2021\\n; none have been convicted by the Senate. Additionally, the\\nHouse Judiciary Committee\\nconducted an impeachment inquiry against Richard Nixon in\\n1973\\u201374\\nand reported  three articles of impeachment to the House of Representatives for final action; however, he resigned from office before the House voted on them.\\n[\\n161\\n]\\nCircumvention of authority\\nControversial measures have sometimes been taken short of removal to deal with perceived recklessness on the part of the president, or with a long-term disability. In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders. This has ranged from\\nRichard Nixon\\n's Chief of Staff not transmitting orders to the Cabinet due to the president's heavy drinking, to staff removing memos from\\nDonald Trump\\n's desk.\\n[\\n163\\n]\\nDecades before the Twenty-fifth Amendment, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson had a\\nstroke that left him partly incapacitated\\n.

Obama has also been active politically since his presidential term ended, having worked with his former vice president\\nJoe Biden\\non his\\n2020 election campaign\\nand Biden's vice president\\nKamala Harris\\non her\\n2024 election campaign\\nafter President Biden\\nwithdrew his bid for re-election\\n.\\nAfter losing his bid for the presidency in 2020, Trump remained politically active and was an outspoken critic of his successor and the Democratic Party. He also contended with four criminal cases. Trump announced his fourth bid to the presidency in 2022, ultimately becoming the nominee of his party for the third time and won a second presidential term in 2024.\\nGrover Cleveland\\nwas also elected to nonconsecutive terms; his reelection bid failed in\\n1888\\nbut succeeded in\\n1892\\n.\\nPension and other benefits\\nThe\\nFormer Presidents Act\\n(FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection; also provided is funding for a certain number of staff and for office expenses.  The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff.  The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by\\nimpeachment\\n.\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nAccording to a 2008 report by the\\nCongressional Research Service\\n:\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nChief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nFormer presidents who served in Congress may also collect\\ncongressional pensions\\n.\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nThe act also provides former presidents with travel funds and\\nfranking\\nprivileges.\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.\\n[\\n189\\n]\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nIn 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nOn January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him,\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n, and all subsequent presidents.\\n[\\n192\\n]\\nA\\nfirst spouse\\nwho remarries is no longer eligible for Secret Service protection.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nWriting\\nMain article:\\nList of autobiographies by presidents of the United States\\nSince the publication of\\nUlysses S. Grant\\n's\\nPersonal Memoirs\\nin 1885, most presidents, including every president who survived to the end of their term from Calvin Coolidge to Barack Obama, has written at least one autobiography.  These autobiographies serve two purposes: to ensure the First Family's financial security (Clinton made over $30 million dollars from writing two books\\n[\\n193\\n]\\n), but also to defend or rehabilitate presidential legacies.\\nPresidential libraries and historic sites\\nMain articles:\\nPresidential library system\\nand\\nList of residences of presidents of the United States\\nThe homes where U.S. presidents were born, lived or vacationed have frequently been preserved as\\nhouse museums\\nand listed as\\nNational Historic Sites\\nor on\\nU.S. National Register of Historic Places\\n.\\nFrom left to right: Presidents\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nGeorge W.

Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nDallas\\nin 2013\\nEvery president since\\nHerbert Hoover\\nhas created a\\nrepository\\nknown as a\\npresidential library\\nfor preserving and making available his papers, records, and other documents and materials. Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the\\nNational Archives and Records Administration\\n(NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.\\n[\\n194\\n]\\nThere are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, including:\\nThe\\nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the State of\\nIllinois\\n;\\nThe\\nGeorge W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by\\nSouthern Methodist University\\n;\\nThe\\nGeorge H. W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by\\nTexas A&M University\\n; and\\nThe\\nLyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the\\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\\n.\\nSeveral former presidents have overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document:\\nThe\\nHarry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nIndependence, Missouri\\n;\\nThe\\nDwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home\\nin\\nAbilene, Kansas\\n;\\nThe\\nRichard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nYorba Linda, California\\n; and\\nThe\\nRonald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nSimi Valley, California\\n.\\nThese gravesites are open to the general public.  In some cases (such as with Nixon), the presidential library is adjacent to one of the president's former homes, where in other cases, such as with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, the presidential library and the historic site are in different cities entirely.\\nPolitical affiliation\\nPolitical parties\\nhave dominated\\nAmerican politics\\nfor most of the nation's history. Though the\\nFounding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from\\npolitical factions\\n, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the\\nWashington administration\\nwere referred to as \\\"pro-administration\\\" and would eventually form the\\nFederalist Party\\n, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\n.\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained\\nunaffiliated\\nwith any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.\\n[\\n196\\n]\\n[\\n197\\n]\\nSince Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office, and, since 1869, every president has been a member of either the\\nRepublican\\nor\\nDemocratic\\nParties.\\n[\\n198\\n]\\n[\\n199\\n]\\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\\nParty\\nNumber of\\npresidents\\nName(s)\\nRepublican\\n19\\nChester\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Arthur\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0H.\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nCalvin\\u00a0Coolidge\\n,\\nDwight\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Eisenhower\\n,\\nGerald\\u00a0Ford\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Garfield\\n,\\nUlysses\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Grant\\n,\\nWarren\\u00a0G.\\u00a0Harding\\n,\\nBenjamin\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nRutherford\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Hayes\\n,\\nHerbert\\u00a0Hoover\\n,\\nAbraham\\u00a0Lincoln\\n,\\n[\\nG\\n]\\nWilliam\\u00a0McKinley\\n,\\nRichard\\u00a0Nixon\\n,\\nRonald\\u00a0Reagan\\n,\\nTheodore\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Howard\\u00a0Taft\\n, and\\nDonald\\u00a0Trump\\n(incumbent)\\nDemocratic\\n15\\nJoe Biden\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Buchanan\\n,\\nJimmy\\u00a0Carter\\n,\\nGrover\\u00a0Cleveland\\n,\\nBill\\u00a0Clinton\\n,\\nAndrew\\u00a0Jackson\\n,\\nLyndon\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Johnson\\n,\\nJohn\\u00a0F.\\u00a0Kennedy\\n,\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0Pierce\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0K.\\u00a0Polk\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nHarry\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Truman\\n,\\nMartin\\u00a0Van\\u00a0Buren\\n, and\\nWoodrow\\u00a0Wilson\\nDemocratic-Republican\\n4\\nJohn\\u00a0Quincy\\u00a0Adams\\n,\\nThomas\\u00a0Jefferson\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Madison\\n, and\\nJames\\u00a0Monroe\\nWhig\\n4\\nMillard\\u00a0Fillmore\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Henry\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nZachary\\u00a0Taylor\\n, and\\nJohn\\u00a0Tyler\\n[\\nH\\n]\\nFederalist\\n1\\nJohn\\u00a0Adams\\nNational Union\\n1\\nAndrew\\u00a0Johnson\\n[\\nI\\n]\\nIndependent\\n(No party)\\n1\\nGeorge\\u00a0Washington\\nTimeline of presidents\\nSee also:\\nList of presidents of the United States\\nThe following\\ntimeline\\ndepicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.\\nSee also\\nUnited States portal\\nPolitics portal\\nOutline of American politics\\nNotes\\n^\\nIn addition to $100,000 in travel reimbursement, $19,000 for entertainment and $50,000 for additional expenses.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\n^\\nThe informal term POTUS originated in the\\nPhillips Code\\n, a shorthand method created in 1879 by\\nWalter P.

Later, while president, Johnson tried and failed to build a party of loyalists under the National Union banner.

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 contains only vague consultation requirements. Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act. Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and unconstitutional, and no president in the past 35 years has filed a report \\\"pursuant\\\" to these triggering provisions.\\n^\\na\\nb\\nc\\nd\\n\\\"The Law: The President's War Powers\\\"\\n.\\nTime\\n.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

The new government did not commence until the old government expired.

In fact, Congress did continue to act as a government until it dissolved on the first of November by the successive disappearance of its members.

Roosevelt\\nand\\nGeorge W. Bush\\n.\\n[\\n13\\n]\\n[\\n14\\n]\\nIn modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining\\nsuperpower\\n.\\n[\\n15\\n]\\n[\\n16\\n]\\n[\\n17\\n]\\nAs the leader of the nation with the\\nlargest economy by nominal GDP\\n, the president possesses significant domestic and international\\nhard\\nand\\nsoft power\\n. For much of the 20th century, especially during the\\nCold War\\n, the U.S. president was often called \\\"the leader of the free world\\\".\\n[\\n18\\n]\\nArticle II of the Constitution\\nestablishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers.  Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world's\\nmost expensive military\\n, which has the\\nsecond-largest nuclear arsenal\\n.\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of\\nseparation of powers\\n,\\nArticle I, Section\\n7\\nof the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or\\nveto\\nfederal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.\\n[\\n19\\n]\\nIn recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of\\nexecutive orders\\n, agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\nThe president is\\nelected indirectly\\nthrough the\\nElectoral College\\nto a four-year term, along with the\\nvice president\\n. Under the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a\\npresident's intra-term death\\nor\\nresignation\\n.\\n[\\nC\\n]\\nIn all,\\n45 individuals\\nhave served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.\\n[\\nD\\n]\\nDonald Trump\\nis the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.\\n[\\n21\\n]\\nHistory and development\\nOrigins\\nIn July 1776, the\\nThirteen Colonies\\n, represented at the\\nSecond Continental Congress\\nin\\nPhiladelphia\\n, unanimously adopted the\\nUnited States Declaration of Independence\\nin which the colonies declared themselves to be independent\\nsovereign states\\nand no longer under\\nBritish\\nrule.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nThe affirmation was made in the\\nDeclaration of Independence\\n, which was written predominantly by\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the\\nBritish\\n,\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nthe Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the\\nstates\\ntogether. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.\\n[\\n24\\n]\\nCongress finished work on the\\nArticles of Confederation\\nto establish a\\nperpetual union\\nbetween the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for\\nratification\\n.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nUnder the Articles, which\\ntook effect\\non March 1, 1781, the\\nCongress of the Confederation\\nwas a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThis institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of\\nCrown\\nand\\nParliament\\nought to have functioned with respect to the royal\\ndominion\\n: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.\\n[\\n23\\n]\\nThe states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly\\nroyal prerogatives\\n(e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a\\npresident of the United States in Congress Assembled\\nto preside over its deliberation as a neutral\\ndiscussion moderator\\n. Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.\\n[\\n25\\n]\\nIn 1783, the\\nTreaty of Paris\\nsecured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nBy 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their\\nhard currency\\npouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their\\nMediterranean\\ncommerce preyed upon by\\nNorth African\\npirates\\n, and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nCivil and political unrest loomed.  Events such as the\\nNewburgh Conspiracy\\nand\\nShays' Rebellion\\ndemonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between\\nVirginia\\nand Maryland at the\\nMount Vernon Conference\\nin 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in\\nAnnapolis, Maryland\\n, with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the\\nconvention\\nfailed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states,\\nAlexander Hamilton\\nof New York led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in\\nPhiladelphia\\n. Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nEdmund Randolph\\nsucceeded in securing\\nGeorge Washington\\n's attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\n[\\n26\\n]\\nWhen the\\nConstitutional Convention\\nconvened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance (\\nRhode Island\\ndid not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nNew York\\noffered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.\\n[\\n22\\n]\\nIt was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the\\nU.S. Constitution\\nemerged.\\n1789\\u20131933\\nGeorge Washington\\n, the first president of the United States\\nAs the nation's first president,\\nGeorge Washington\\nestablished many norms that would come to define the office.\\n[\\n27\\n]\\n[\\n28\\n]\\nHis decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the\\nTwenty-Second Amendment\\n. By the end of his presidency, political parties had developed,\\n[\\n29\\n]\\nwith\\nJohn Adams\\ndefeating\\nThomas Jefferson\\nin 1796, the first truly contested presidential election.\\n[\\n30\\n]\\nAfter Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow Virginians\\nJames Madison\\nand\\nJames Monroe\\nwould each serve two terms, eventually dominating the nation's politics during the\\nEra of Good Feelings\\nuntil Adams' son\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwon election in 1824 after the\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\nsplit.\\nThe election of\\nAndrew Jackson\\nin 1828 was a significant milestone, as Jackson was not part of the Virginia and Massachusetts elite that had held the presidency for its first 40 years.\\n[\\n31\\n]\\nJacksonian democracy\\nsought to strengthen the presidency at the expense of Congress, while broadening public participation as the nation rapidly expanded westward. However, his successor,\\nMartin Van Buren\\n, became unpopular after the\\nPanic of 1837\\n,\\n[\\n32\\n]\\nand the death of\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nand subsequent poor relations between\\nJohn Tyler\\nand Congress led to further weakening of the office.\\n[\\n33\\n]\\nIncluding Van Buren, in the 24 years between 1837 and 1861, six presidential terms would be filled by eight different men, with none serving two terms.\\n[\\n34\\n]\\nThe Senate played an important role during this period, with the\\nGreat Triumvirate\\nof\\nHenry Clay\\n,\\nDaniel Webster\\n, and\\nJohn C.

Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\nSigning and vetoing bills\\nPresident\\nLyndon B. Johnson\\nsigns the\\n1964 Civil Rights Act\\nat the\\nWhite House\\non July 2, 1964, as\\nMartin Luther King Jr.\\nand others look on.\\nThe president's most significant legislative power derives from the\\nPresentment Clause\\n, which gives the president the power to veto any\\nbill\\npassed by\\nCongress\\n. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\nof both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \\\"tyranny of the majority\\\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.  The veto \\u2013 or threat of a veto \\u2013 has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\nSign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill\\nbecomes law\\n.\\nVeto\\nthe legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a\\ntwo-thirds vote\\n.\\nTake no action on the legislation within the above timeframe\\u2014the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a\\npocket veto\\n.\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president's veto power with the\\nLine Item Veto Act\\n. The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In\\nClinton v. City of New York\\n,\\n524\\nU.S.\\n417\\n(1998), the\\nU.S. Supreme Court\\nruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\nSetting the agenda\\nPresident\\nDonald Trump\\ndelivers his\\n2018 State of the Union Address\\nbefore\\nCongress\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda.\\nArticle II, Section 3, Clause 2\\nrequires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \\\"necessary and expedient\\\". This is done through the constitutionally-based\\nState of the Union\\naddress, which usually outlines the president's legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.\\n[\\n68\\n]\\nPresidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.\\n[\\n69\\n]\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.\\n[\\n70\\n]\\nPromulgating regulations\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of\\nagencies\\nthat can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \\\"virtual army of 'czars'\\u2014each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\\\".\\n[\\n71\\n]\\nPresidents have been criticized for making\\nsigning statements\\nwhen signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.\\n[\\n66\\n]\\nThis practice has been criticized by the\\nAmerican Bar Association\\nas unconstitutional.\\n[\\n72\\n]\\nConservative commentator\\nGeorge Will\\nwrote of an \\\"increasingly swollen executive branch\\\" and \\\"the eclipse of Congress\\\".\\n[\\n73\\n]\\nConvening and adjourning Congress\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by\\nArticle II, Section\\n3\\nof the Constitution to call a\\nspecial session\\nof one or both houses of Congress. Since\\nJohn Adams\\nfirst did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions.\\nHarry S. Truman\\nwas the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the\\nTurnip Day Session\\n. In addition, prior to ratification of the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\nin 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly\\ninaugurated\\npresidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.\\n[\\n74\\n]\\n[\\n75\\n]\\nExecutive powers\\nMain article:\\nPowers of the president of the United States\\nSuffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\nNixon v.

Generally, a president may remove executive officials at will.\\n[\\n80\\n]\\nHowever, Congress can curtail and constrain a president's authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by\\nstatute\\n.\\n[\\n81\\n]\\nTo manage the growing federal bureaucracy, presidents have gradually surrounded themselves with many layers of staff, who were eventually organized into the\\nExecutive Office of the President of the United States\\n. Within the Executive Office, the president's innermost layer of aides, and their assistants, are located in the\\nWhite House Office\\n.\\nThe president also possesses the power to manage operations of the federal government by issuing various\\ntypes of directives\\n, such as\\npresidential proclamation\\nand\\nexecutive orders\\n. When the president is lawfully exercising one of the constitutionally conferred presidential responsibilities, the scope of this power is broad.\\n[\\n82\\n]\\nEven so, these directives are subject to\\njudicial review\\nby U.S. federal courts, which can find them to be unconstitutional.

Such agreements, upon receiving the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate (by a\\ntwo-thirds majority\\nvote), become binding with the force of federal law.\\nWhile foreign affairs has always been a significant element of presidential responsibilities, advances in technology since the Constitution's adoption have increased presidential power.

However, these nominations require\\nSenate confirmation\\nbefore they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to\\nU.S. district courts\\n, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of\\nsenatorial courtesy\\n. Presidents may also grant\\npardons\\nand\\nreprieves\\n.\\nGerald Ford\\npardoned\\nRichard Nixon\\na month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when\\nBill Clinton\\npardoned\\nPatty Hearst\\non his last day in office; this is often\\ncontroversial\\n.\\n[\\n98\\n]\\n[\\n99\\n]\\n[\\n100\\n]\\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is\\nexecutive privilege\\n, which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see\\nChief Justice\\nJohn Jay\\n's notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with\\nGreat Britain\\n. While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington's action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the\\nWatergate scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nUnited States v. Nixon\\n, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the\\nLewinsky scandal\\n, the Supreme Court ruled in\\nClinton v. Jones\\n, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the\\nlegal precedent\\nthat executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.\\n[\\n101\\n]\\nThe\\nstate secrets privilege\\nallows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from\\ndiscovery\\nin legal proceedings if such release would harm\\nnational security\\n. Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when\\nThomas Jefferson\\nrefused to release military documents in the\\ntreason\\ntrial of\\nAaron Burr\\nand again in\\nTotten v. United States\\n, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.\\n[\\n102\\n]\\nHowever, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until\\nUnited States v. Reynolds\\n, where it was held to be a\\ncommon law\\nevidentiary\\nprivilege.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\nBefore the\\nSeptember 11 attacks\\n, use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.\\n[\\n104\\n]\\nSince 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the\\nNinth Circuit\\n's ruling in\\nMohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\\n[\\n103\\n]\\n[\\n105\\n]\\n[\\n106\\n]\\nCritics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.\\n[\\n107\\n]\\n[\\n108\\n]\\nThe degree to which the president personally has\\nabsolute immunity\\nfrom court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions.\\nNixon v. Fitzgerald\\n(1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions.\\nClinton v. Jones\\n(1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019\\nMueller report\\non Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible\\nobstruction of justice\\n, but investigators declined to refer\\nDonald Trump\\nfor prosecution based on a\\nUnited States Department of Justice\\npolicy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy. As of October 2019, a case was pending in the federal courts regarding access to personal tax returns in a criminal case brought against Donald Trump by the\\nNew York County District Attorney\\nalleging violations of New York state law.\\n[\\n109\\n]\\nMemoranda from the\\nOffice of Legal Counsel\\nissued in 1973 and 2000 internally prohibit the Department of Justice from prosecuting a president, which some legal scholars have criticized but others have endorsed.\\n[\\n110\\n]\\nIn defense against federal criminal prosecution for his\\nalleged 2020 election subversion\\n, in January 2024, Trump argued to the\\nDC Circuit Court of Appeals\\nthat a president enjoys absolute immunity for criminal acts conducted while in office. The next month, a three-judge panel of the court unanimously ruled against Trump. It was the first time an appeals court had addressed such a presidential immunity matter, since no other sitting or former president had ever been criminally indicted.\\n[\\n111\\n]\\nIn\\nTrump v. United States\\n, on July 1, 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents were entitled to absolute immunity from exercising core powers enumerated by the Constitution,\\npresumption\\nof immunity for other official acts, and no immunity for unofficial actions. The case was sent back to lower courts to determine which actions in the criminal complaint should be classified as official vs. unofficial.\\n[\\n112\\n]\\nThe ruling was the first time the courts granted a president criminal immunity.\\nLeadership roles\\nHead of state\\nFour ruffles and flourishes and 'Hail to the Chief' (long version)\\nProblems playing this file? See\\nmedia help\\n.\\nAs\\nhead of state\\n, the president represents the United States government to its own people and represents the nation to the rest of the world. For example, during a state visit by a foreign head of state, the president typically hosts a\\nState Arrival Ceremony\\nheld on the\\nSouth Lawn\\n, a custom begun by\\nJohn F. Kennedy\\nin 1961.\\n[\\n113\\n]\\nThis is followed by a\\nstate dinner\\ngiven by the president which is held in the\\nState Dining Room\\nlater in the evening.\\n[\\n114\\n]\\nPresident\\nWoodrow Wilson\\nthrows out the ceremonial first ball on\\nOpening Day\\nin 1916\\nPresident\\nBill Clinton\\nreviews honor guards at\\nBuckingham Palace\\nduring a 1995 state visit to the UK\\nAs a national leader, the president also fulfills many less formal ceremonial duties. For example,\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\nstarted the tradition of throwing out the\\nceremonial first pitch\\nin 1910 at\\nGriffith Stadium\\n, Washington, D.C., on the\\nWashington Senators's\\nOpening Day\\n.

Since 1989, when the custom of \\\"pardoning\\\" the turkey was formalized by\\nGeorge H. W. Bush\\n, the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural life.\\n[\\n118\\n]\\nPresidential traditions also involve the president's role as head of government. Many outgoing presidents since\\nJames Buchanan\\ntraditionally give advice to their successor during the\\npresidential transition\\n.\\n[\\n119\\n]\\nRonald Reagan\\nand his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on\\nInauguration Day\\nfor the incoming president.\\n[\\n120\\n]\\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation's premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration\\npublic relations\\nofficials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \\\"propagandized leadership\\\" which has a \\\"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\\\".\\n[\\n121\\n]\\nAdministration public relations managers staged carefully crafted\\nphoto-ops\\nof smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.\\n[\\n122\\n]\\nOne critic wrote the image of John F. Kennedy was described as carefully framed \\\"in rich detail\\\" which \\\"drew on the power of myth\\\" regarding the incident of\\nPT 109\\n[\\n123\\n]\\nand wrote that Kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions.\\n[\\n124\\n]\\nAs a result, some political commentators have opined that American voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents: voters expect a president to \\\"drive the economy, vanquish enemies, lead the free world, comfort tornado victims, heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card fees\\\".\\n[\\n125\\n]\\nHead of party\\nThe president is typically considered to be the\\nde facto\\nhead and spokesperson of their political party.  With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party's voters.  Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party's presidential candidate. The\\ncoattail effect\\n, or lack thereof, will also often impact a party's candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party's caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective.  Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\nGlobal leader\\nWith the rise of the United States as a\\nsuperpower\\nin the 20th century, and the United States having the world's largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world's most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of\\nNATO\\n, and the country's strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the\\nEuropean Union\\n, have led to the moniker that the president is the \\\"\\nleader of the free world\\n\\\".\\nSelection process\\nEligibility\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 5\\nof the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency. To serve as president, one must:\\nbe a\\nnatural-born citizen of the United States\\n;\\nbe at least 35 years old;\\nbe a\\nresident in the United States\\nfor at least 14 years.\\n[\\n126\\n]\\nA person who meets the above qualifications would, however, still be disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditions:\\nUnder\\nArticle I, Section 3, Clause 7\\n, having been impeached, convicted and disqualified from holding further public office, although there is some legal debate as to whether the disqualification clause also includes the presidential office: the only previous persons disqualified under this clause were three federal judges.\\n[\\n127\\n]\\n[\\n128\\n]\\nUnder\\nSection 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment\\n, no person who swore an oath to support the Constitution, and later rebelled against the United States, is eligible to hold any office. However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.\\n[\\n129\\n]\\nThere is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding\\nConfederates\\nfrom public office after the Civil War.\\n[\\n130\\n]\\nUnder the\\nTwenty-second Amendment\\n, no person can be elected president more than twice. The amendment also specifies that if any eligible person serves as president or acting president for more than two years of a term for which some other eligible person was elected president, the former can only be elected president once.\\n[\\n131\\n]\\n[\\n132\\n]\\nPrior experience\\nMain articles:\\nList of presidents of the United States by other offices held\\n,\\nList of presidents of the United States by previous experience\\n, and\\nList of presidents of the United States by education\\nThere are no requirements for previous or concurrent offices held by the President or presidential candidates.

There has never been a property qualification for the Presidency or other federal offices, but, in the early years of the republic, there were\\nproperty qualifications for voting\\nor for some of the stepping-stone offices to the Presidency (particularly governorships).  Prior to the Civil War, it was common for presidents to be men of significant property: Presidents from the North tended to own small farms, while several Southern presidents owned plantations and\\nslaves\\n.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n[\\n135\\n]\\nWhile several later presidents came from abject poverty, others, such as the Roosevelts, John Kennedy, and Donald Trump, were parties to extensive family fortunes.\\n[\\n134\\n]\\n33 of the 45 men who served as President, including every president since 1953 and all but one since 1901, have had a bachelor's degree.

As prescribed by Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, each state is entitled to a number of electors equal to the size of its total delegation in both houses of Congress. Additionally, the\\nTwenty-third Amendment\\nprovides that the District of Columbia is entitled to the number it would have if it were a state, but in no case more than that of the least populous state.\\n[\\n136\\n]\\nCurrently, all states and the District of Columbia select their electors based on a popular election.\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nIn all but two states, the party whose presidential\\u2013vice presidential\\nticket\\nreceives a\\nplurality\\nof popular votes in the state has its entire\\nslate\\nof elector nominees chosen as the state's electors.\\n[\\n138\\n]\\nMaine\\nand\\nNebraska\\ndeviate from this\\nwinner-take-all\\npractice, awarding two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each\\ncongressional district\\n.\\n[\\n139\\n]\\n[\\n140\\n]\\nOn the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, about six weeks after the election, the electors convene in their respective state capitals (and in Washington, D.C.) to vote for president and, on a separate ballot, for vice president. They typically vote for the candidates of the\\nparty\\nthat nominated them. While there is no constitutional mandate or federal law requiring them to do so, the District of Columbia and 32 states have laws requiring that their electors vote for the candidates to whom they are\\npledged\\n.\\n[\\n141\\n]\\n[\\n142\\n]\\nThe constitutionality of these laws was upheld in\\nChiafalo v. Washington\\n(2020).\\n[\\n143\\n]\\nFollowing the vote, each state then sends a certified record of their electoral votes to Congress. The votes of the electors are opened and counted during a joint session of Congress, held in the first week of January. If a candidate has received an\\nabsolute majority\\nof electoral votes for president (currently 270 of 538), that person is declared the winner. Otherwise, the\\nHouse of Representatives\\nmust meet to elect a president using a\\ncontingent election\\nprocedure in which representatives, voting by state delegation, with each state casting a single vote, choose between the top\\nthree\\nelectoral vote-getters for president. To win the presidency, a candidate must receive the votes of an absolute majority of states (currently 26 of 50).\\n[\\n137\\n]\\nThere have been two contingent presidential elections in the nation's history. A 73\\u201373 electoral vote tie between\\nThomas Jefferson\\nand fellow Democratic-Republican\\nAaron Burr\\nin the\\nelection of 1800\\nnecessitated the first. Conducted under the original procedure established by\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause\\n3\\nof the Constitution, which stipulates that if two or three persons received a majority vote and an equal vote, the House of Representatives would choose one of them for president; the\\nrunner-up\\nwould become vice president.\\n[\\n144\\n]\\nOn February 17, 1801, Jefferson was elected president on the 36th ballot, and Burr elected vice president. Afterward, the system was overhauled through the\\nTwelfth Amendment\\nin time to be used in the\\n1804 election\\n.\\n[\\n145\\n]\\nA quarter-century later, the choice for president again devolved to the House when no candidate won an absolute majority of electoral votes (131 of 261) in the\\nelection of 1824\\n. Under the Twelfth Amendment, the House was required to choose a president from among the top three electoral vote recipients:\\nAndrew Jackson\\n,\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\n, and\\nWilliam H. Crawford\\n. Held February 9, 1825, this second and most recent contingent election resulted in John Quincy Adams being elected president on the first ballot.\\n[\\n146\\n]\\nInauguration\\nMain article:\\nUnited States presidential inauguration\\nPursuant to the\\nTwentieth Amendment\\n, the four-year term of office for both the president and the vice president begins at noon on January 20, in the year following the preceding presidential election.\\n[\\n147\\n]\\nThe first presidential and vice presidential terms to begin on this date, known as\\nInauguration Day\\n, were the\\nsecond terms\\nof President\\nFranklin D.

Deaths have occurred a number of times, resignation has occurred only once, and removal from office has never occurred.\\nBefore the ratification of the Twenty-fifth amendment (which clarified the matter of succession),\\nArticle II, Section 1, Clause 6\\n, stated only that the vice president assumes the \\\"powers and duties\\\" of the presidency in the event of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability.\\n[\\n156\\n]\\nUnder this clause, there was ambiguity about whether the vice president would actually become president in the event of a vacancy, or simply\\nact\\nas president,\\n[\\n157\\n]\\npotentially resulting in a\\nspecial election\\n. Upon the death of President\\nWilliam Henry Harrison\\nin 1841, Vice President\\nJohn Tyler\\ndeclared that he had succeeded to the office itself, refusing to accept any papers addressed to the \\\"Acting President\\\", and Congress ultimately accepted it.\\nIn the event of a double vacancy, Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 also authorizes Congress to declare who shall become acting president in the \\\"Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the president and vice president\\\".\\n[\\n157\\n]\\nThe\\nPresidential Succession Act\\nof 1947 (codified as 3 U.S.C. \\u00a7 19) provides that if both the president and vice president have left office or are both otherwise unavailable to serve during their terms of office, the\\npresidential line of succession\\nfollows the order of: speaker of the House, then, if necessary, the president pro tempore of the Senate, and then if necessary, the eligible heads of\\nfederal executive departments\\nwho form the president's\\ncabinet\\n. The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created. Those individuals who are constitutionally ineligible to be elected to the presidency are also disqualified from assuming the powers and duties of the presidency through succession. No statutory successor has yet been called upon to act as president.\\n[\\n158\\n]\\nDeclarations of inability\\nMain article:\\nTwenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution\\nUnder the Twenty-fifth Amendment, the president may temporarily transfer the presidential powers and duties to the vice president, who then becomes\\nacting president\\n, by transmitting to the\\nspeaker of the House\\nand the\\npresident\\npro tempore\\nof the Senate\\na statement that he is unable to discharge his duties. The president resumes his or her powers upon transmitting a second declaration stating that he is again able. The mechanism has been used by\\nRonald Reagan\\n(once),\\nGeorge W.

In some cases, staff have intentionally failed to deliver messages to or from the president, typically to avoid executing or promoting the president to write certain orders.

In-country trips are typically handled with just one of the two planes, while overseas trips are handled with both, one primary and one backup. The president also has access to smaller Air Force aircraft, most notably the\\nBoeing C-32\\n, which are used when the president must travel to airports that cannot support a jumbo jet.

Prominent examples include\\nWilliam Howard Taft\\n's tenure as\\nchief justice of the United States\\nand\\nHerbert Hoover\\n's work on government reorganization after\\nWorld War II\\n. Two former presidents served in Congress after leaving the White House:\\nJohn Quincy Adams\\nwas elected to the House of Representatives, serving there for 17 years, and\\nAndrew Johnson\\nreturned to the Senate in 1875, though he died soon after.

Bill Clinton also worked as an informal ambassador, most recently in the negotiations that led to the release of two American\\njournalists\\n,\\nLaura Ling\\nand\\nEuna Lee\\n, from\\nNorth Korea\\n. During his presidency, George W. Bush called on former presidents George H. W. Bush and Clinton to assist with humanitarian efforts after the\\n2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami\\n. President Obama followed suit by asking presidents Clinton and George W. Bush to lead efforts to aid Haiti after an\\nearthquake\\ndevastated that country in 2010.  Clinton's relationship with the two Bushes is not the first friendship between former presidents: Carter enjoyed a friendship and correspondence with\\nGerald Ford\\n, while Jefferson and\\nJohn Adams\\nhad an extended correspondence through letters in their post-presidencies.\\nClinton has been active politically since his presidential term ended\\n, working with his wife\\nHillary\\non her\\n2008\\nand\\n2016\\npresidential bids and President Obama on his\\n2012 reelection campaign\\n.

He also contended with four criminal cases. Trump announced his fourth bid to the presidency in 2022, ultimately becoming the nominee of his party for the third time and won a second presidential term in 2024.\\nGrover Cleveland\\nwas also elected to nonconsecutive terms; his reelection bid failed in\\n1888\\nbut succeeded in\\n1892\\n.\\nPension and other benefits\\nThe\\nFormer Presidents Act\\n(FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection; also provided is funding for a certain number of staff and for office expenses.  The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff.  The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by\\nimpeachment\\n.\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nAccording to a 2008 report by the\\nCongressional Research Service\\n:\\n[\\n186\\n]\\nChief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman's financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.\\n[\\n187\\n]\\nFormer presidents who served in Congress may also collect\\ncongressional pensions\\n.\\n[\\n188\\n]\\nThe act also provides former presidents with travel funds and\\nfranking\\nprivileges.\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death.\\n[\\n189\\n]\\n[\\n190\\n]\\nIn 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.\\n[\\n191\\n]\\nOn January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him,\\nGeorge W.

Completed libraries are deeded to and maintained by the\\nNational Archives and Records Administration\\n(NARA); the initial funding for building and equipping each library must come from private, non-federal sources.\\n[\\n194\\n]\\nThere are currently thirteen presidential libraries in the NARA system. There are also presidential libraries maintained by state governments and private foundations and Universities of Higher Education, including:\\nThe\\nAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the State of\\nIllinois\\n;\\nThe\\nGeorge W.

Bush Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by\\nTexas A&M University\\n; and\\nThe\\nLyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library and Museum\\n, which is run by the\\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\\n.\\nSeveral former presidents have overseen the building and opening of their own presidential libraries. Some even made arrangements for their own burial at the site. Several presidential libraries contain the graves of the president they document:\\nThe\\nHarry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nIndependence, Missouri\\n;\\nThe\\nDwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home\\nin\\nAbilene, Kansas\\n;\\nThe\\nRichard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nYorba Linda, California\\n; and\\nThe\\nRonald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum\\nin\\nSimi Valley, California\\n.\\nThese gravesites are open to the general public.  In some cases (such as with Nixon), the presidential library is adjacent to one of the president's former homes, where in other cases, such as with Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter, the presidential library and the historic site are in different cities entirely.\\nPolitical affiliation\\nPolitical parties\\nhave dominated\\nAmerican politics\\nfor most of the nation's history. Though the\\nFounding Fathers\\ngenerally spurned political parties as divisive and disruptive, and their rise had not been anticipated when the U.S. Constitution was drafted in 1787, organized political parties developed in the U.S. in the mid-1790s nonetheless. They evolved from\\npolitical factions\\n, which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the\\nWashington administration\\nwere referred to as \\\"pro-administration\\\" and would eventually form the\\nFederalist Party\\n, while those in opposition largely joined the emerging\\nDemocratic-Republican Party\\n.\\n[\\n195\\n]\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained\\nunaffiliated\\nwith any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president never to be affiliated with a political party.\\n[\\n196\\n]\\n[\\n197\\n]\\nSince Washington, every U.S. president has been affiliated with a political party at the time of assuming office, and, since 1869, every president has been a member of either the\\nRepublican\\nor\\nDemocratic\\nParties.\\n[\\n198\\n]\\n[\\n199\\n]\\nThe number of presidents per political party by their affiliation at the time they were first sworn into office (alphabetical, by last name) are:\\nParty\\nNumber of\\npresidents\\nName(s)\\nRepublican\\n19\\nChester\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Arthur\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0H.\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nGeorge\\u00a0W.\\u00a0Bush\\n,\\nCalvin\\u00a0Coolidge\\n,\\nDwight\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Eisenhower\\n,\\nGerald\\u00a0Ford\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0A.\\u00a0Garfield\\n,\\nUlysses\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Grant\\n,\\nWarren\\u00a0G.\\u00a0Harding\\n,\\nBenjamin\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nRutherford\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Hayes\\n,\\nHerbert\\u00a0Hoover\\n,\\nAbraham\\u00a0Lincoln\\n,\\n[\\nG\\n]\\nWilliam\\u00a0McKinley\\n,\\nRichard\\u00a0Nixon\\n,\\nRonald\\u00a0Reagan\\n,\\nTheodore\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Howard\\u00a0Taft\\n, and\\nDonald\\u00a0Trump\\n(incumbent)\\nDemocratic\\n15\\nJoe Biden\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Buchanan\\n,\\nJimmy\\u00a0Carter\\n,\\nGrover\\u00a0Cleveland\\n,\\nBill\\u00a0Clinton\\n,\\nAndrew\\u00a0Jackson\\n,\\nLyndon\\u00a0B.\\u00a0Johnson\\n,\\nJohn\\u00a0F.\\u00a0Kennedy\\n,\\nBarack Obama\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0Pierce\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0K.\\u00a0Polk\\n,\\nFranklin\\u00a0D.\\u00a0Roosevelt\\n,\\nHarry\\u00a0S.\\u00a0Truman\\n,\\nMartin\\u00a0Van\\u00a0Buren\\n, and\\nWoodrow\\u00a0Wilson\\nDemocratic-Republican\\n4\\nJohn\\u00a0Quincy\\u00a0Adams\\n,\\nThomas\\u00a0Jefferson\\n,\\nJames\\u00a0Madison\\n, and\\nJames\\u00a0Monroe\\nWhig\\n4\\nMillard\\u00a0Fillmore\\n,\\nWilliam\\u00a0Henry\\u00a0Harrison\\n,\\nZachary\\u00a0Taylor\\n, and\\nJohn\\u00a0Tyler\\n[\\nH\\n]\\nFederalist\\n1\\nJohn\\u00a0Adams\\nNational Union\\n1\\nAndrew\\u00a0Johnson\\n[\\nI\\n]\\nIndependent\\n(No party)\\n1\\nGeorge\\u00a0Washington\\nTimeline of presidents\\nSee also:\\nList of presidents of the United States\\nThe following\\ntimeline\\ndepicts the progression of the presidents and their political affiliation at the time of assuming office.\\nSee also\\nUnited States portal\\nPolitics portal\\nOutline of American politics\\nNotes\\n^\\nIn addition to $100,000 in travel reimbursement, $19,000 for entertainment and $50,000 for additional expenses.\\n[\\n10\\n]\\n^\\nThe informal term POTUS originated in the\\nPhillips Code\\n, a shorthand method created in 1879 by\\nWalter P.

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 contains only vague consultation requirements. Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act. Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and unconstitutional, and no president in the past 35 years has filed a report \\\"pursuant\\\" to these triggering provisions.\\n^\\na\\nb\\nc\\nd\\n\\\"The Law: The President's War Powers\\\"\\n.\\nTime\\n.

In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.
