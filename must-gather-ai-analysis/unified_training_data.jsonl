Here are the key differences:\n\n## KMS v1 (Legacy - Deprecated)\n\n### Characteristics:\n- **Introduced**: Kubernetes 1.10\n- **Status**: Deprecated in Kubernetes 1.28\n- **Protocol**: Uses gRPC API v1beta1\n- **Performance**: Slower due to individual key encryption\n- **Caching**: Limited caching capabilities\n\n### Configuration Example:\n```yaml\napiVersion: apiserver.k8s.io/v1\nkind: EncryptionConfiguration\nresources:\n- resources:\n  - secrets\n  providers:\n  - kms:\n      name: myKmsPlugin\n      endpoint: unix:///tmp/socketfile.sock\n      # No cachesize or timeout options\n```\n\n### Feature Gate:\n```bash\n# KMS v1 doesn't require explicit feature gate in older versions\nkube-apiserver --encryption-provider-config=/etc/kubernetes/encryption-config.yaml\n```\n\n## KMS v2 (Current - Recommended)\n\n### Characteristics:\n- **Introduced**: Kubernetes 1.25 (Alpha), 1.27 (Beta), 1.29 (GA)\n- **Status**: Stable and recommended\n- **Protocol**: Uses gRPC API v2\n- **Performance**: Significantly faster with envelope encryption\n- **Caching**: Advanced caching with configurable size and timeout\n- **Security**: Enhanced with key derivation functions\n\n### Configuration Example:\n```yaml\napiVersion: apiserver.k8s.io/v2\nkind: EncryptionConfiguration\nresources:\n- resources:\n  -

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How to troubleshoot KMS encryption issues in OpenShift?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Troubleshooting KMS encryption issues in OpenShift requires systematic investigation of multiple components. Here's a comprehensive troubleshooting guide:\n\n## 1. Check Cluster Operator Status\n\n```bash\n# Check overall cluster health\noc get co\n\n# Look for degraded operators, especially:\n# - kube-apiserver\n# - openshift-apiserver  \n# - authentication\n```\n\n**Common Issues:**\n- `kube-apiserver`: KMS plugin connectivity problems\n- `openshift-apiserver`: API server deployment failures\n- `authentication`: OAuth server issues due to encryption problems\n\n## 2. Verify KMS Feature Gate and Configuration\n\n```bash\n# Check if KMS feature gate is enabled\noc get featuregate cluster -o yaml | grep -A 10 KMSEncryptionProvider\n\n# Verify APIServer encryption configuration\noc get apiserver cluster -o yaml\n\n# Check for configuration errors\noc describe apiserver cluster\n```\n\n## 3. Examine KMS Plugin Status\n\n```bash\n# Check KMS plugin pods\noc get pods -n openshift-kube-apiserver -l name=aws-kms-plugin -o wide\n\n# Check pod logs for errors\noc logs -n openshift-kube-apiserver -l name=aws-kms-plugin\n\n# Check plugin health endpoint\noc exec -n openshift-kube-apiserver <kms-pod> -- curl localhost:18081/healthz\n```\n\n**Common KMS Plugin Issues:**\n```\n# Socket connection errors\n\"dial unix /var/kube-kms/socket.sock: connect: no such file or directory\"\n\n# AWS authentication errors\n\"The security token included in the request is invalid\"\n\n# KMS key access errors\n\"The request is missing an Authentication Token\"\n```\n\n## 4. Check kube-apiserver Logs\n\n```bash\n# Get kube-apiserver pod logs\noc logs -n openshift-kube-apiserver kube-apiserver-<node-name>\n\n# Look for KMS-related errors\noc logs -n openshift-kube-apiserver kube-apiserver-<node-name> | grep -i kms\n\n# Check health check failures\noc logs -n openshift-kube-apiserver kube-apiserver-<node-name> | grep \"kms-providers check failed\"\n```\n\n**Common API Server Errors:**\n```\n# KMS plugin health check failures\n\"kms-providers check failed: readyz [-]kms-providers failed\"\n\n# Connection timeouts\n\"rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = latest balancer error\"\n\n# Plugin initialization errors\n\"failed to create connection to unix socket\"\n```\n\n## 5. Verify AWS KMS Accessibility\n\n```bash\n# Test AWS credentials\naws sts get-caller-identity\n\n# Verify KMS key exists and is accessible\naws kms describe-key --key-id <key-arn> --region <region>\n\n# Check key status\naws kms describe-key --key-id <key-arn> --region <region> --query 'KeyMetadata.KeyState'\n\n# Test encryption/decryption\necho \"test\" | aws kms encrypt --key-id <key-arn> --region <region> --plaintext fileb://-\n```\n\n**KMS Key Issues:**\n- Key is disabled: `\"KeyState\": \"Disabled\"`\n- Key is pending deletion: `\"KeyState\": \"PendingDeletion\"`\n- Insufficient permissions: `\"AccessDenied\"`\n\n## 6. Check Encryption Configuration Secrets\n\n```bash\n# Get current API server revision\noc get kubeapiserver cluster -o json | jq '.status.latestAvailableRevision')\n\n# Check encryption configuration for current revision\noc get secrets -n openshift-kube-apiserver encryption-config-<revision> -o json | \\\n  jq -r '.data[\"encryption-config\"]' | base64 -d | jq\n```\n\n**Configuration Analysis:**\n- Verify KMS provider is first in the list\n- Check endpoint paths match plugin socket locations\n- Ensure timeout values are appropriate\n\n## 7. Test Secret Encryption\n\n```bash\n# Create test secret\noc create secret generic kms-test --from-literal=password=\"test123\" -n default\n\n# Check if secret is encrypted in etcd\noc exec -n openshift-etcd etcd-<master-node> -- \\\n  etcdctl get /kubernetes.io/secrets/default/kms-test | hexdump -C\n\n# Look for KMS encryption prefix: k8s:enc:kms:v2:\n```\n\n**Encryption Verification:**\n```\n# Encrypted with KMS v2:\n6b 38 73 3a 65 6e 63 3a 6b 6d 73 3a 76 32 3a  |k8s:enc:kms:v2:|\n\n# Not encrypted (identity):\n7b 22 61 70 69 56 65 72 73 69 6f 6e 22 3a 22  |{\"apiVersion\":\"|\n```\n\n## 8. Recovery Procedures\n\n### Temporary Disable Encryption\n```bash\n# Switch to identity encryption (no encryption)\noc patch apiserver cluster --type=merge -p '{\n  \"spec\": {\n    \"encryption\": {\n      \"type\": \"identity\",\n      \"kms\": null\n    }\n  }\n}'\n```\n\n### Fix KMS Key Issues\n```bash\n# Enable disabled KMS key\naws kms enable-key --key-id <key-arn> --region <region>\n\n# Cancel key deletion\naws kms cancel-key-deletion --key-id <key-arn> --region <region>\n```\n\n### Restart KMS Plugin\n```bash\n# Delete KMS plugin pods to restart\noc delete pods -n openshift-kube-apiserver -l name=aws-kms-plugin\n\n# Check pods restart successfully\noc get pods -n openshift-kube-apiserver -l name=aws-kms-plugin -w\n```\n\n## 9. Monitoring and Alerting\n\n```bash\n# Check KMS plugin health metrics\noc exec -n openshift-kube-apiserver <kms-pod> -- curl localhost:18081/metrics\n\n# Monitor API server encryption metrics\nkubectl get --raw /metrics | grep apiserver_storage_transformation\n```\n\n## 10. Common Resolution Steps\n\n1. **Socket Permission Issues:**\n   ```bash\n   # Check socket file permissions\n   oc exec -n openshift-kube-apiserver <kms-pod> -- ls -la /var/kube-kms/\n   ```\n\n2. **AWS IAM Role Issues:**\n   ```bash\n   # Verify master node IAM role has KMS permissions\n   aws iam get-role-policy --role-name <master-role> --policy-name <kms-policy>\n   ```\n\n3. **Network Connectivity:**\n   ```bash\n   # Test AWS API connectivity from nodes\n   oc debug node/<master-node> -- chroot /host curl -I https://kms.us-east-1.amazonaws.com\n   ```\n\n4. **Cluster Recovery:**\n   ```bash\n   # Force cluster operator reconciliation\n   oc patch kubeapiserver cluster --type=merge -p '{\"spec\":{\"forceRedeploymentReason\":\"recovery-$(date +%s)\"}}'\n   ```\n\n## Best Practices for Prevention\n\n1. **Always test KMS configuration in non-production first**\n2. **Monitor KMS key status and quotas**\n3. **Set up alerts for cluster operator degradation**\n4. **Document key rotation procedures**\n5. **Maintain backup access to etcd for emergency recovery**\n6. **Verify AWS IAM permissions are correctly configured**\n7. **Test disaster recovery procedures regularly**\n\nRemember: KMS encryption is critical infrastructure. Always have a rollback plan and test procedures in non-production environments first."}]}
